## Briefing Document: The Magic of Product Sense

Product sense, sometimes called product thinking, product intuition, or product judgment, is a crucial skill for product managers (PMs).

---

### 1. Definition and Scope

**Product sense** is defined as **thinking creatively and critically about a product's strengths and weaknesses**. It represents the distinct way great PMs analyze products.

Crucially, product sense requires looking beyond one's personal opinion or preference about a product. Instead, it is focused explicitly on the product itself and the ability to anticipate **how the broader market will react** to it, judging whether people will love it or hate it, and understanding the underlying reasons.

Before becoming a PM, the speaker noted that they rarely thought beyond how a product personally affected them, but this changed when they adopted product sense.

### 2. Importance of Product Sense

Product sense is the **one skill unique to product people** among the eight essential skills that differentiate great PMs (the other seven are necessary for any leadership role).

This skill is fundamental because:

*   It enables PMs to **design products that people adore**.
*   It is necessary to figure out what a team should build given **limited time and resources**.
*   It is one of the **top skills tested in PM interviews**.
*   It allows PMs to **make good product decisions faster, more often, and ultimately build great products**.

### 3. Product Sense: More Like Cooking Than Magic

From an outsider's perspective, a product manager with product sense may appear to possess "magic" because they seem to know instinctively what users will love or hate. However, product sense is **not magic; it is a skill that can be learned**.

The development of product sense is compared to learning to cook:

*   A new PM often starts by **leaning on best practices and templates**—referred to as following "recipes" shared by senior PMs.
*   An experienced PM with great product sense, like a great cook, builds products in surprising and unexpected ways **from scratch**.
*   They possess a sense of which "ingredients" (product attributes) might work well together.
*   Developing this expertise takes time, just as it took Steve Jobs time to develop his product sense (which eventually succeeded where the Apple Lisa, a financial disaster, failed).

### 4. Developing Product Sense: The Three Pillars

The process for developing product sense is rooted in three key concepts: **observation, curiosity, and repetition**.

#### A. Observation
Observation involves breaking down how people react to products and identifying which product attributes cause those reactions.

Key observation steps include:

1.  **Self-Reaction Analysis:** Start by observing your own reaction to a product, asking how it makes you feel and if it solves your problem.
2.  **Strengths and Weaknesses:** Determine what specifically makes a product good or not so good.
3.  **Infer Company Goals:** Infer the company's business goal behind the product and assess whether they have achieved it, and what could be improved. This practice should also be applied to your own product, talking to customers to see if their feelings align with business goals.
4.  **Peer Observation:** Practice this analysis with friends, asking questions that elicit their love or discontent for a product.

#### B. Curiosity and Creativity
Product managers applauded for their surprising successes often demonstrate curiosity by seeing what others didn't, leading to **innovative technical solutions**.

*   **Experimentation:** Curiosity involves trying new things, especially when it goes against the status quo, to learn what works and what doesn't. Like a chef mixing unexpected ingredients, PMs test ideas to understand why people like or dislike them.
*   **Small-Scale Testing:** Risky "ingredients" should be tested on a small scale first, such as through mockups, prototypes, MVPs, and AB tests on a small user set. The core goal is **learning from every attempt**.
*   **Technological Understanding:** To be creative in tech, you must understand **what's technologically possible**, which requires learning your tech stack and studying its capabilities and limitations.
*   **Originality:** While the best "recipes" are derived from others, PMs must avoid lazy copying. The goal is to learn from product leaders, follow their recipes, and then **reduce them and put yourself on the plate** over years of experience.

#### C. Repetition
Product sense does not happen overnight; it takes years to master. There is **no substitute for hard work and repetition**. Product sense develops with each decision you make, as you observe and become curious about what worked and what didn't.

**Analogy:** Developing product sense is like a firefighter learning to become a gourmet chef. Initially, they follow established recipes (best practices). Over time, through continuous observation and bold experimentation (curiosity), they gain an intuitive sense for combining random ingredients (data, technology, user needs) to create delicious, unexpected, and successful new dishes (innovative products).
