# Product Strategy Briefing: Defining Focus and Driving Results

## Introduction

Product strategy is often misunderstood; many companies mistake it for a road map, a list of features, or recycled objectives (OKRs). Fundamenty, product strategy is about **making choices**. Learning product strategy can be one of the hardest things for product leaders, especially those who naturally want to make all stakeholders feel heard and happy.

In organizations that use a product model, product teams are set up to solve hard problems in ways that customers love and that work for the business. The role of product strategy is to **choose which hard problems to solve**.

## Defining Product Strategy

A product strategy determines **which problems to solve right now** or the critical problems to solve.

The goal of product strategy is twofold:

1.  To identify critical problems that will take the company **towards its vision**.
2.  To identify critical problems that will **pay the bills along the way**.

Product strategy is often framed as **making bets**. A product strategy is a living document and should be updated at least **quarterly**.

## Key Distinctions: Strategy, Vision, and Business Strategy

Strategy is a term used broadly (e.g., marketing, business). It is critical to differentiate product strategy from other key organizational concepts:

| Concept | Description | Relationship to Product Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Business Strategy** | Defines how the company wins, including high-level choices like geographical focus (e.g., domestic vs. global) or sales models (e.g., direct sales, PLG, channel sales). | **Drives** the product strategy. Product strategy reflects the business strategy and is designed to make it true or make it happen. |
| **Product Vision** | Articulates the "mountain top"—the overall direction, inspiring customers and teams, and outlining all the problems the company eventually wants to solve. | Product strategy explains **how we get there** and how we address current objectives. While smaller companies might not require a formal vision, larger organizations (with more than 10 product teams) need vision to ensure everyone is rowing in the same direction. |
| **Road Map** | Often just prioritized lists of features and projects that are handed down to teams. | **Is not** product strategy. When strategy is absent, companies rely on these prioritized lists, leading to complaints about prioritization. |
| **Go-to-Market Strategy** | Defines how products get into the hands of customers. | Is driven by the business strategy and is also influenced by the product strategy. |

## The Role of Focus and Prioritization

The absence of a clear product strategy often manifests as a "prioritization problem".

*   **Strategy is Focus:** A good product strategy means making hard choices about **what you will and especially what you won't do**. This is essential for focus.
*   **The Power of Choices:** If leaders complain that they have too many priorities (e.g., cutting a list of 70 things to seven "smart bets" that are still compromises), they actually have a **lack of focus problem**, not a prioritization problem.
*   **Encouraging Real Focus:** Since most leaders haven't experienced the power of real focus, one coaching technique is to run a **test**. Leaders are asked to pick **one bet**—the single most important thing—they must nail to deliver a big win this year. While focus doesn't have to be limited to just one item, it should ideally not exceed two or three items.
*   **Keep the Lights On (KLO):** Focus does not mean stopping necessary maintenance work ("keep the lights on") or addressing technical debt. These are separate activities that must continue to prevent business suicide, but they should not represent the majority of a team's work.

## Creating a Strong Product Strategy

### Ownership and Politics

The creation of the product strategy is primarily the **product leader's job**. However, politically, the product leader must first **earn the right** to lead the strategy by winning the trust of stakeholders and proving they can deliver real business results.

To transition control from stakeholders to the product leader, the first step is to shift current feature roadmaps into **outcome-based roadmaps**. This involves defining the problem to be solved or the outcome to be achieved for each request.

### Inputs and Artifacts

A robust product strategy requires transparency and logic, laying out the data and reasoning.

Key elements to include in the strategy output:

1.  **The Problems to Solve:** The critical problems chosen for the current period (e.g., this quarter or year).
2.  **The Why (Strategic Context):** The evidence, data, argument, logic, and hypothesis supporting the choices. Sharing the *why* is crucial for teams to perform better.

A highly regarded artifact for communicating strategy is a **six-page written narrative**. This written format helps ensure the thinking is clear, data-informed, and transparent.

### Role of Product Teams

Empowered product teams are skilled in both problem discovery (identifying good problems) and solution discovery (solving them).

To build trust, teams are often coached to focus primarily on **solution discovery** for the identified problems. However, during solution discovery, teams will run up against new, real problems (minor or important). Teams should bring these identified problems to the **product leader**, as they serve as one of the best inputs for the next quarter's product strategy.

### Strategy and Annual Planning

In many companies, the primary purpose of annual planning is dealing with the **absence of strategy**. Annual planning often involves a "dog and pony show" where executives pitch proposals to secure funding.

When a product strategy is in place, annual planning shifts from solely deciding what to fund to focusing on high-level alignment, discussing business strategy, go-to-market decisions, and sharing learnings.

## Strategy Failures and Pivots

A strategy can fail even if it is beautiful, logical, and well-informed if **execution is very difficult** and the teams are unable to crack the code on a solution. One technique for critical problems is to assign the problem to ** multiple teams** to leverage different skill sets and increase the likelihood of achieving the desired outcome.

A strategic pivot occurs when results or external events (like the COVID pandemic) reveal that the current bets are unlikely to pay off or the strategy is a non-starter. Strategies change frequently based on quarterly results and new learnings, while the product vision typically remains stable.
