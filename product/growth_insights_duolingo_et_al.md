## Briefing Document: Albert Cheng's Successful Strategies for Monetizing and Growing Consumer Subscription Products

Albert Cheng, known as one of the top consumer growth minds in the world, has led growth and monetization efforts at highly successful consumer subscription products including Duolingo, Grammarly, and Chess.com, blending marketing, data strategy, and product management. His approach is founded on maximizing user retention, leveraging data insights, and optimizing the freemium user journey.

### I. Foundational Growth Philosophy and Retention Focus

| Strategy | Details and Insights | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Connect Users to Value** | The core job of growth is to **connect users to the value of your product**. Cheng focuses on thinking about the user holistically, recognizing that the value a user seeks can change over time. | |
| **User Retention is Gold** | **User retention is gold** for consumer subscription companies. If retention is not high, the burden falls on aggressively getting users to pay on Day 1, which is "super hard". | |
| **D1 Retention Benchmark** | Achieving **Day 1 (D1) retention of 30% to 40%** is considered solid for a consumer app. | |
| **Current User Retention** | For products with daily frequency (like Duolingo or Chess.com), the retention of the **existing user base** (users who have developed a habitual pattern) is the most critical metric, as this compounds and builds daily habit. | |
| **Resurrected User Experience** | For mature companies with large numbers of dormant or sporadic users, it is crucial to spend time crafting an **excellent resurrected experience** inside the product to bring users back, such as using social notifications (e.g., Duolingo contact sync) or placement tests to align users with their current skill level. | |

### II. Key Monetization Win: Sampling Premium Features (Grammarly)

Cheng's biggest monetization win at Grammarly focused on changing the perception of the free product:

*   **Problem:** Historically, the lived product experience for most free users was that Grammarly was merely a tool to fix spelling and grammar. The free suggestions were limited to correctness things, while premium offered tone improvement, clarity rewrites, and full sentence rewrites.
*   **Winning Strategy:** Change the model to **sample a number of different paid suggestions** and interspersed them to free users across their writing. This provided a limited "taste" of the premium offering.
*   **Result:** This modernization learning caused free users to see Grammarly as a "much more powerful tool", and **upgrade rates nearly doubled**.
*   **Freemium Model Advice:** The core value proposition should be **permanently free** to maximize product spread, align with the mission, and drive word-of-mouth growth. Premium features should then be layered on top, often through sampling.

### III. Growth Framework: Explore and Exploit

Cheng utilizes the Explore and Exploit framework (which he attributes partly to Reforge) to structure growth work:

| Phase | Objective & Action | Example/Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Explore** | Finding the right "mountain to climb". This requires divergent thinking and creative solutions. | For growth, AI tools like prototyping platforms (VZero, Figma make) help PMs visualize and discuss bolder ideas, speeding up the harder exploratory phase. |
| **Exploit** | Focusing resources on climbing the chosen mountain effectively. This is crucial when an insight is found. | **Chess.com Example:** Found that 80% of game reviews happened after a win, counterintuitive to the belief that users seek reviews after losses. Exploiting this insight meant changing the loss experience to show brilliant/best moves and using encouraging language ("losing just part of learning"). This change grew game reviews by 25% and subscriptions by 20%. |
| **Expansion (10x)** | When a win or key insight is discovered, it must be **shared broadly across the company** and expanded 10x across adjacent features. This prevents local maximization and ensures broad organizational impact. | The Chess.com insight was audited across other product patterns (e.g., puzzles) to make experiences more positive, by tweaking copy or success ratings. |
| **Saturation Signal** | If teams start seeing more experiments that are **not statistically significant**, this may signal that exploitation mode is saturated, and teams should be encouraged to return to divergent brainstorming and exploration. |

### IV. Experimentation Practices and Scale

Cheng advocates for high-volume, structured experimentation to accelerate learning:

*   **Volume Goal:** Cheng encourages setting an ambitious target, like running **1,000 experiments a year** (roughly 3 per day). The goal is not just the number itself, but to drive conversation and necessary organizational changes (e.g., enabling no-code configuration, involving marketing/content teams) to achieve that pace.
*   **Starting Point:** Teams must "just start somewhere" by running an AB test. Cheng warns that without testing, companies leave opportunities on the table because consumer behavior is unpredictable and power users (internal staff) may forget the experience of a brand new user.
*   **Learning Focus:** The output of one experiment is the input to the next idea. Even **hugely losing experiments are valuable** and should be surfaced broadly for organizational learning.
*   **AI Integration:** AI is used to speed up the experiment cycle, for example, by plugging analysis documents into tools like ChatGPT for quick summarization and ideation advice.

### V. Product-Led Virality and Brand

While growth often gets a reputation for "metrics hacking", Cheng believes that growth experimentation and brand/community combine well to create "rocket fuel":

*   **Brand Impact:** Brand work (like Duolingo's Duo the Owl) can be a "big wave" that quadrupeles registrations overnight. Some channels can bring in **20-30% of new users** on any given day.
*   **Leaning into Organic Sharing:** To enhance virality, Cheng advises identifying moments where users are already **organically screenshotting** (e.g., streak milestones, funny challenges) and then staffing those moments with illustrators and animators to make them "delightful" and easier to share.

### VI. Leveraging AI for Efficiency and Data Access

Cheng uses AI to increase speed and data accessibility within the company:

*   **Accelerated Prototyping:** Product managers use AI prototyping tools (like VZero or lovable) to quickly translate ideas into representative solutions, carving out main screens (onboarding, home screen) to make ideas more "discussable and hopefully testable relatively soon".
*   **Democratizing Data (Text-to-SQL):** Chess.com is working on **text-to-SQL capability** via Slack bots to answer one-off, ad hoc data questions (e.g., subscriber counts in specific regions). This makes the company as a whole much more data-informed and leads to a large explosion of questions being asked.
