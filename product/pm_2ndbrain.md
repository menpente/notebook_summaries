## Briefing Document: Leveraging AI as a Product Manager's Second Brain

Amir Klein, an AI Product Manager at monday.com and one of the top five AI-powered PMs on his team, is highly dependent on and "maybe incapable of doing [his] job without AI". He uses Claude and ChatGPT to manage the difficulty of **context switching** inherent to the PM role, setting up independent, fully loaded "brains" to hold context and increase efficiency.

### I. The "Second Brain" Concept (Projects/Custom GPTs)

Klein structures his work by creating dedicated projects or "brains" in Claude and ChatGPT/Custom GPTs.

#### A. Components of a Project:
A typical project contains:
1.  **Files:** A growing number of files (starting with two or three, potentially reaching 20 or more).
2.  **Instructions:** Guidelines for the AI.
3.  **Threads:** Endless amounts of conversation history.

#### B. Populating the Knowledge Base:
To initiate a project, Klein begins with a "ping pong," providing data to help the AI understand what he aims to achieve. Key context files include:

*   **Initial Data:** Any available data, company kickoff decks, team kickoff decks, or references to PRs (Product Requirements).
*   **Text Transformation:** Because "literally everything is text," documents that are not naturally text files (like Google Slides, competitor pricing pages, marketing websites, or support pages) are downloaded or printed as **PDFs** and uploaded to the GPT/Claude.
*   **Instructional Prompts:** Instructions ensure the AI acts as a professional and expert in product management, possesses a good product strategy and product sense mindset, and provides **candid feedback**. Klein instructs the AI to **challenge him** and push back on ideas, as he dislikes when the AI is overly supportive.

#### C. Core Use Cases (Thought Partner & Deliverables):
These second brains act as thought partners and streamline deliverables:

*   **Outlining Documents:** Projects typically start with a scope designed to result in an outline or overview document that aids in PPRD (Product Review), or other team deliverables.
*   **Iterative Knowledge Building:** After generating an overview document, Klein downloads it, uploads it back into the AI’s knowledge base, and uses it as a basis for subsequent work. The more work done, the more intuitive and fluid the subsequent conversations become.
*   **Handling Quick Requests:** The AI handles requests that interrupt the day, such as writing a concise "two-line sentence" description for marketing or communications teams when releasing something.

### II. Specific AI Use Cases and Workflows

Klein demonstrated three major workflows utilizing AI to enhance his role, focusing heavily on gathering unbiased information, receiving candid feedback, and improving communications.

#### A. Gathering Unbiased Customer Feedback via Scraping and Analysis (The AI Agents Project)

When tasked with leading the AI agents initiative at monday.com, Klein faced a common PM problem: a complex project with many internal voices and differing aspirations, necessitating an unbiased view of customer expectations and desires.

1.  **Scraping for Data:** Klein used **Claude** to help him scrape thousands of conversations from Reddit.
    *   Initially, he asked Claude for help scraping everything written about monday.com and AI across LinkedIn, Twitter, and Reddit.
    *   Claude helped narrow the accessible sources and provided a step-by-step, automated guide for a non-technical user on how to set up the necessary environment (using Brew, terminal commands, and making a developer account).
    *   The script generated by Claude used Klein's client ID, client secret, and username to scrape posts related to Monday, AI, and other keywords.
    *   The result was a file containing 34,000 rows of conversation threads.

2.  **Data Analysis:** Klein then used **Claude** to act as his analyst:
    *   He uploaded the large file (30,000+ rows) and requested a summary table focusing on data needed for prioritization.
    *   The table included metrics like **frequency**, **percentage weights**, and **key discussion points**.
    *   To fact-check the AI's analysis, Klein requires Claude to reference at least one or two quotes from the source document for each key point.

#### B. Creating a Conciseness Coach Custom GPT

To address professional development feedback that his writing was too long (specifically his Slack messages):

1.  **Feedback Integration:** Klein took feedback from past managers and colleagues and created a custom GPT to coach him on concise writing.
2.  **Knowledge Base:** He loaded the custom GPT with expert guidance, including newsletters (like Lenny’s featuring Wescow’s recommendations) and related books on writing.
3.  **Instructions:** The GPT's instructions mandated it rewrite Slack messages to be **more concise, clearer, and readable**. It was also told to **maintain the user's natural voice** and to avoid excessive use of dashes or bullet points.
4.  **Practice:** Klein writes the full message in Slack, copies it, pastes it into the GPT, and receives a concise revision, noting that people now respond to his messages more often. He shared this tool with colleagues who might have the same issue. This approach transformed the difficult process of integrating feedback into daily practice by creating a specific, dedicated coach.

#### C. Interview Preparation using GPT Voice Mode

To prepare for product interviews, where he previously relied on watching the same mock interview videos obsessively, Klein utilizes GPT Voice Mode for interactive practice:

1.  **Immersive Practice:** Voice mode provides a natural, interactive experience that simulates the interview process better than text-based GPT, making him feel like he has an "interview coach who's with me at all times".
2.  **Custom Setup (Structured or Freestyle):**
    *   He can freestyle using the standard Voice Mode.
    *   He also created a structured Custom GPT for interview prep, which contains knowledge from his own PM interview prep document and posts by product coaching expert Ben Harris. This GPT has instructions on sequencing product sense and product execution questions (e.g., clarify mission, identify target users, pinpoint pain points, design a solution).
3.  **Critical Instructions:** When initiating a mock interview, he gives key constraints to ensure quality coaching:
    *   **Don't guide or lead him** to an answer.
    *   Be **super candid** and objective.
    *   Let him "take the reins".
    *   Provide candid feedback at the end.
4.  **Learning Over Time:** By doing back-to-back interviews with Voice Mode, the AI can learn from previous conversations, noting improvements, such as his ability to narrow down different user segments.

### III. General AI Usage Philosophy

*   **PM Efficiency Advantage:** The primary benefit of using AI is the ability to be in multiple places simultaneously, allowing him to answer questions quickly on the spot.
*   **Addressing Bad AI Results:** When the AI provides bad results, Klein’s tactic is to copy the response and use it as a benchmark for correction, telling the AI: "This isn't what I was looking for. This is an example what I was looking for". Before Voice Mode, he used **caps lock** to express frustration; now, he admits to yelling/getting upset when in Voice Mode.
*   **Future Project:** Inspired by his workflows, Klein is developing a "vibe-coded" scraper that will allow users to input natural language requests to scrape discussions related to specific keywords from any platform.
