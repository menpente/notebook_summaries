# Briefing Document: Product Strategy, AI, and Entrepreneurship Insights

This briefing summarizes key insights from Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer and Executive Vice President of Design and Emerging Products at Adobe, drawing on his experience as a product legend, founder of Behance, and author of *The Messy Middle*.

---

## 1. Product Sense and Customer Empathy

Scott Belsky emphasizes that successful product development hinges on deep customer empathy, rather than passion for a pre-conceived solution.

*   **Empathy drives solutions:** When teams develop empathy for the customer suffering the problem, the empathy often reveals the correct solution. Passion for an imagined solution might be 30 degrees off what the solution actually is.
*   **Building Empathy:** To build empathy, product leaders should be "shoulder to shoulder" with customers, watching them go about their entire day, not just using the product. This provides crucial context about where the customer is mentally—amidst meetings, pings, children, or watching Netflix—which helps inform product design.
*   **Psychology in Design:** Product sense involves understanding the **psychology** and natural human tendencies of users, especially in their most primal moments.

## 2. Optimizing the First Mile Experience

The "first mile" (onboarding flow, initial experience, orientation, and defaults) is critical, as it often yields the biggest wins for improving retention and growth.

*   **User Psychology in the First Mile:** In the first 30 seconds of using a new product, users are **lazy, vain, and selfish**. They want to look good to colleagues/friends, feel successful quickly, and avoid watching tours, reading instructions, or enduring a learning curve.
*   **Time Allocation Mistake:** Most teams spend the "final mile" of their product building time considering the "first mile" of the customer experience.
*   **The Changing Customer Cohort:** The first mile must be constantly reimagined because new customers change. Early customers are typically more forgiving, but later-stage customers (pragmatists) are initially more skeptical, less forgiving, and less tolerant of friction. For example, the affordability of Photoshop brought in a larger funnel of users who lacked the skills or tolerance for the old onboarding experience, necessitating a full change.
*   **AI and Onboarding:** Scott Belsky is excited for the day when AI enables products to **meet us where we are**, personalizing the onboarding experience based on the type of user, moving away from generalized experiences.

## 3. The Power of Reduction (Doing Half the Features)

Scott Belsky advises product teams to build only **half the features** they plan to, offer half the options, and focus on half the market they initially target.

*   **Optimize for Good Problems:** Teams should optimize for the problems they *want* to have, such as customers getting value and then asking for capabilities like sharing, platform support, or new functionality. Products should focus only on eliminating the major "brick walls" that prevent customers from reaching the point where they care enough to ask for more.
*   **The Behance Lesson:** At Behance, removing features like the "tip exchange" and "groups" resulted in the core metric (publishing projects in the portfolio) operating at **10x the velocity**. Making the entire product about "one thing" maximizes that core operational metric.
*   **Reductionism:** Great product leaders tend to have a **reductionist or minimalistic tendency** by default, prioritizing the one core thing they want people to do well.

## 4. AI's Disruption and the Future of Work

Scott Belsky views the rise of AI optimistically, believing it will free human ingenuity by eliminating mundane, repetitive labor.

*   **From Workflow to Flow:** AI will shift processes from "workflow" to "flow," getting rid of the friction and allowing for greater human ingenuity.
*   **Increased Possibility:** Historically, increased productivity for roles like engineers has led to greater demands and possibilities, not fewer roles. AI may enable companies to launch five, seven, or 30 products instead of three.
*   **Collapsing the Stack:** AI is expected to collapse the functional stack in organizations, empowering people to conduct more cross-functional work. For instance, a Product Manager may be able to do more design, engineering, or data analysis without constantly relying on specialized analysts.
*   **PM and Designer Superpowers:** Generative AI will give PMs and designers the superpower of exploring a **far greater surface area of possibilities** in much less time, allowing them to find better solutions.
*   **Staying Relevant:** Scott Belsky’s primary advice for PMs to stay ahead is to **play** with the technology (e.g., trying various generative AI tools and pursuing every curiosity).
*   **Adobe’s AI Focus:** Adobe's current strategy is driven by three waves of transformation: increasing creative confidence through tools like Adobe Express and Firefly, enabling creative professionals to explore 10x the surface area, and enhancing personalization in marketing and commerce experiences.

## 5. Enduring the Messy Middle and Knowing When to Quit

Scott Belsky highlights that the middle years of any venture are characterized by volatility, lows, uncertainty, and anxiety.

*   **Endurance Strategies:** Leaders must overcome the biological need for constant rewards and affirmation. This requires finding and celebrating **micro goals and milestones** to short-circuit the reward system and keep the team motivated.
*   **Merchandising Progress:** Product leaders must be the **steward of the narrative**, constantly merchandising progress to the team (likened to telling passengers in a blacked-out car that they are making progress or crossing state lines).
*   **The Quitting Test:** When a founder is struggling, the decision to continue or quit rests on one question: **"Now knowing all you know, do you have more or less conviction in the problem and the solution you’re building?"**.
    *   **More Conviction:** If conviction has increased despite repeated product failures, the advice is to **stick with it** because they are simply in the messy middle.
    *   **Less Conviction:** If conviction has been lost (e.g., realizing they wouldn't have started the company knowing what they know now), they should quit, pivot, or do something else.

## 6. Angel Investing Criteria

When investing, Scott Belsky looks for specific attributes in the founding team and the product design.

*   **Team Attributes:**
    *   Founders who **listen and learn**.
    *   Leaders who value the mission more than the money.
    *   Preference for leaders who are **optimistic about the future** but pragmatic and somewhat pessimistic about the present—openly discussing obstacles, struggles, and what is not working.
    *   Wary of "promoters" who sugarcoat the truth.
*   **Product Attributes (Object Model):**
    *   The product must utilize a scalable **object model** that clearly answers three core questions on every screen: **"How did I get here?", "What do I do now?", and "What do I do next?"**.
    *   A product lacking clear organization or "bread crumbs" is a red flag, indicating that the team does not value this principle.
    *   The investor must ultimately believe in the problem the team is solving.

## 7. Resourcefulness vs. Resources

In the current resource-constrained environment, Scott Belsky stresses that **resourcefulness** will take teams further than resources. Teams must build the muscle to be resourceful and refactor (e.g., rethinking databases or leveraging new technology like AI for efficiency) instead of relying on hiring more people or spending more money. This forcing function of crisis helps teams build muscle that goes the distance.
