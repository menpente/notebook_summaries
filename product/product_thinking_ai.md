# Briefing Document: Product Thinking in the Age of AI

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Iaagq49LN0
## Overview
This briefing outlines the shifting landscape of product management as of **2025-2026**, focusing on the massive growth in the AI job market and the critical need for Product Managers (PMs) to evolve their **product thinking** and research workflows using AI tools.

## 1. Key Market Trends
*   **AI Job Explosion:** After a stagnant period in 2023, the market saw a significant jump in **2025**, with **11,000 to 12,000 AI-specific jobs opening up**. The slope of this growth suggests there are now more AI PM roles than traditional PM roles.
*   **The Competitive Shift:** OpenAI is losing market share to rivals **Anthropic** and **Gemini**. 
    *   **Anthropic's "Single Strategy":** They have focused aggressively on **enterprise and developers**, releasing tools like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Claude Code.
    *   **Google's Vertical Stack:** Google is catching up by leveraging a full vertical stack, including **TPUs, DeepMind research, and a massive consumer feedback base**.
*   **Strategic Focus:** OpenAI's perceived mistake was spreading too thin—venturing into hardware, consulting, and advertising—while Anthropic maintained a targeted execution on platform and enterprise needs.

## 2. The Five Pillars of Product Thinking
Traditional product intuition is being redefined by the speed of AI. PMs must master these five areas, which can now be researched in hours rather than weeks:
1.  **Product Life Cycle:** Knowing the right process for the right time.
2.  **Market Dynamics:** Understanding the broader environment that can "make or break" a product.
3.  **Customer Understanding:** Focusing on culture, behavior, and specific needs.
4.  **Product Solution:** Transitioning from discovery to delivery.
5.  **Go to Market:** Executing the final release strategy.

## 3. Deep Dive: Market Dynamics
To determine if "the juice is worth the squeeze," PMs must analyze five specific dynamic areas:
*   **Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM):** Start with the **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**, but focus execution on the **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**—the niche where you can actually start.
*   **Competition:** Identify **Direct** (same product), **Substitute** (similar problem, different tech), and **Alternative** (solves problem in a different way) competitors.
*   **Tech Maturity:** Assess if a market is technically ready for the product (e.g., high-end VR may work in the US but not yet in emerging markets).
*   **Economic Sentiment:** Understanding the current financial climate.
*   **Regulation:** Navigating legal constraints.

## 4. Understanding Customer "Jobs to be Done"
PMs must look beyond functional requirements to capture the full customer experience:
*   **Functional Needs:** The task the user is trying to accomplish.
*   **Emotional Needs:** The feelings driving the purchase, such as **confidence or reduced anxiety**.
*   **Social Needs:** How the product helps the user relate to others.
*   **Customer Journey Mapping:** Analyze the user’s state **Before, During, and After** interacting with the product to find untapped opportunities.

## 5. AI-Accelerated Workflows & Tooling
The modern PM uses AI as an execution engine to validate ideas faster:
*   **Perplexity:** Recommended for **market research** due to its ability to analyze latest news and market sizing.
*   **Cross-Verification (Judge/Executor Model):** To reduce hallucinations, use one AI (like ChatGPT) to generate an insight and another (like Perplexity or Claude) to act as a **"judge"** to find common ground and verify data.
*   **Vibe Coding/Prototyping:** Use AI to build quick prototypes and "vibe code" solutions to test assumptions immediately.
*   **Metrics of Success:** Map growth, engagement, and monetization metrics directly across the customer journey using AI frameworks.

## Conclusion
In the age of AI, **product thinking is becoming more important as execution (writing code) becomes easier**. The PM's role is shifting from managing delivery to asking the right questions and focusing on high-potential markets where the "market pulls the product out of the team".
