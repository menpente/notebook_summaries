# Briefing: World-Class Go-To-Market (GTM) in the AI Era

## Context and Strategic Summary

In the current market, intensified competition requires companies to make their ability to bring a product to market and differentiate themselves strategically critical. World-class GTM organizations must integrate functions and leverage technology to increase efficiency and consultation,. Crucially, 80% of customers purchase to **avoid pain or reduce risk**, rather than to increase upside. Therefore, GTM strategies must focus on helping customers derisk their decisions and avoid negative outcomes (e.g., brand damage, missing revenue targets),.

## I. Defining Go-To-Market (GTM)

GTM encompasses **any function that will touch a customer or make a dollar**.

| Function Categories | Description | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core GTM** | Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, Support, Partnerships. | |
| **Technical Sales Roles** | Sales Engineers and post-sales Platform Architects. | |
| **GTM Evolution** | Due to consumption-based models and AI uncertainty, GTM orgs are shifting from transactional selling to a **more consultative approach**, embedding with customers to understand what they are trying to do and helping them bring technology to life,. |, |

**Core Sales Roles Primer:**

*   **Sales Development Representative (SDR):** Responsible for pipeline generation, qualifying prospective customers to ensure it is worth an Account Executive's time. SDRs can handle **inbound leads** (contact sales) or conduct **outbound prospecting** to targeted markets.
*   **Account Executive (AE):** Responsible for **closing** deals, taking a prospect from being interested with a legitimate problem to believing the product is the best and being willing to pay for it.

## II. The Rise of the Go-To-Market Engineer (GTME)

The GTM Engineer is an emerging role leveraging AI to rearchitect sales workflows and enable personalized customer experiences at scale.

### Role and Function

1.  **Workflow Automation:** GTMEs automate processes by defining the **human workflow** and encoding it using code or agents,. They break down GTM functions into discrete workflows and turn those into agents where AI is better placed than a human to perform the task.
2.  **Profile:** The ideal GTME often has prior GTM experience. At Vercel, the first GTMEs were **Sales Engineers** who had technical expertise (e.g., front-end developers) and understood the GTM process,.
3.  **Impact (Inbound Example):** A Lead Agent built by a single GTME (spending 25-30% of their time over six weeks) allowed a sales team to move **9 out of 10 SDRs to outbound functions**,. This agent maintained the lead-to-opportunity conversion rate while increasing efficiency by condensing the number of touches required for conversion.

### AI Agents and Build vs. Buy

Organizations are finding value in **internal agent development** because their own content and esoteric workflows are key to unlocking the power of AI.

*   **Cost Efficiency:** Internal agent development can be fast and inexpensive. For instance, a lead agent running full-stack can cost around **$1,000 to operate for an entire year**, a significant reduction compared to the cost of a full sales team.
*   **AI Deal Bots (LostBot/DealBot):** AI agents can be run against transcripts from Gong, emails, and Slack interactions to analyze lost opportunities. The "LostBot" can diagnose the true reason for a loss (e.g., inability to demonstrate value or lack of contact with the economic buyer), often contradicting the reasons cited by the Account Executive. The "DealBot" provides real-time insights into Slack channels, such as flagging when a deal is progressing without engagement from the economic buyer.
*   **Human in the Loop:** Current best practice involves having a human in the loop. Agents perform deep research and draft responses, but a human reviews the output and hits send, ensuring the communication is targeted and on-brand,.

## III. GTM Strategy and Tactics

### Thinking of GTM as a Product

When technical differentiation narrows (products are only different at the margin), the **experience of being sold to** increasingly differentiates a company and drives buying decisions.

*   **Customer Journey Mapping:** GTM should be mapped out and orchestrated like a product, focusing on creating a unique customer buying journey,.
*   **Collaborative Experiences:** Instead of standard Q&A discovery calls, creating collaborative sessions (like whiteboarding the customer's payment architecture) provides the customer with an asset and positions the salesperson as a deeply interested partner,.
*   **Value at Every Touchpoint:** Aim to add value to the customer at every interaction, even if they do not buy. For example, providing data insights into their website performance relative to peers demonstrates immediate value and expertise,.

### Segmentation and Alignment

Segmentation is how a company carves up the world of existing companies to reason about them, especially how they buy differently.

*   **Beyond Size:** While size (SMB, mid-market, enterprise) influences buying complexity, segmentation must also incorporate attributes that relate directly to the product offering.
*   **Key Attributes:** Attributes should correlate with high potential for revenue success. Examples include:
    *   **Growth Potential:** Important for consumption-based businesses, separating fast-growers from slow-growers.
    *   **Business Model/Workload Type:** Segmenting by B2B, B2C, platform models, or workload (e.g., e-commerce vs. crypto) helps craft targeted sales content,.
    *   **External Data:** Observables like high site traffic (Crux scores) can push a smaller company into the "enterprise" segment due to the complexity and revenue potential they represent (e.g., treating a high-traffic startup like a large enterprise).
*   **Company-Wide Alignment:** Segmentation should be viewed as a **company thing**, not just a GTM thing, ensuring that Product Managers and Engineers understand who they are building for and how that aligns with GTM motions.

### Sales and Engineering Partnership

To build a GTM organization that engineers and product teams like, the sales team must have **incredible product depth**.

*   **The Litmus Test:** The goal is that if an Account Executive were placed in front of 10 engineers, it should take those engineers 10 minutes to realize the AE is not a Product Manager.
*   **Sales as R&D:** The best GTM organizations serve as equal parts revenue driving and **R&D**, translating customer feedback into actionable signal for the product roadmap.
*   **The GM Mindset:** Salespeople should think like a general manager, understanding when to push back on feature requests versus identifying a genuine market opportunity.
*   **Hiring Diversification:** Companies should value a diversified portfolio of sales professionals, pairing those with traditional sales experience with those from quantitative backgrounds like **consulting or banking**. This mix helps AEs better understand P&L, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis, and how to communicate effectively with CFOs.
