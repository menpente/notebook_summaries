## Briefing: Product and Leadership Wisdom from Stewart Butterfield

Stewart Butterfield is a founder and product legend, known for founding Flickr and then Slack, which he sold to Salesforce in one of the biggest acquisitions in tech history at the time. He rarely does podcasts, making his insights on product and leadership craft particularly valuable. Since leaving Salesforce 2.5 years ago, he has been spending time with family and engaging in philanthropic and personal creative art projects.

### I. Core Product Mental Models

#### Utility Curves
The concept of utility curves provides a lens for determining where to focus product resources. This curve is visualized as an S-curve, plotting cost/effort (or quality, convenience, or speed) on the horizontal axis against value/convenience on the vertical axis.

1.  **Initial Effort:** The first bit of effort yields very little value.
2.  **Magic Threshold:** After reaching a certain point, investment produces an **enormous amount of value** (the steep part of the curve).
3.  **Diminished Returns:** Continued investment then yields diminishing returns.

The goal is to investigate whether a feature is on the first shallow part of the curve, the steep part, or the second shallow part. If you don't climb the curve to the point where users say, "I can't live without this," nothing else matters. The standards bar, referred to as "the line," continually rises (a concept related to "divine discontent") as users become familiar with software, necessitating continued investment. A poor example is the Google Calendar iOS time zone picker, which presents hundreds of time zones in alphabetical order, offering no value or convenience despite the app being used by hundreds of millions of people.

#### Friction vs. Comprehension ("Don't Make Me Think")
The belief that friction must always be removed (e.g., reducing the number of clicks or taps) is often a poor approach.

*   **When Friction Removal Matters:** Reducing friction is beneficial only when the user's intent and the specificity of that intent are already high (e.g., purchasing concert tickets, authentication, or checkout flows in e-commerce).
*   **The Real Challenge:** For 70% to 80% of product design, the core challenge is **comprehension**. People need to understand "what is this thing" and "what am I supposed to do next".
*   **Don't Make Me Think:** The replacement mantra for reducing friction should be **"don't make me think"**. Causing users to think consumes biological resources (glucose, ATP) and, critically, creates an emotional cost because if a user doesn't understand a choice, they may feel stupid and associate that negative feeling with the product. Reducing clicks is meaningless if the remaining clicks require difficult decisions or complex comparisons.

#### The Owner's Delusion
This is the tendency for creators or owners to anticipate a level of user intent and focus that simply doesn't exist. Owners often design products (or websites, like old restaurant sites) that are "inscrutable" because they don't recognize that users are "regular human beings who have like stuff going on" and whose intent is often at the "absolute minimum threshold" required to take action.

### II. Craftsmanship, Taste, and Delight

Slack was famous for being one of the early consumerized B2B SAS products that leaned into delight and experience.

#### Taste and Tilting Your Umbrella
Stewart Butterfield argues that leaning into good taste and craft can create a real advantage because most companies do not invest in it. Taste can be practiced and developed, like becoming a better chef.

The philosophy of taste and courtesy is encapsulated in the metaphor: **"tilting your umbrella is our opportunity"**. This comes from noticing how few people on a crowded sidewalk would move their umbrella out of the way for others. This failure to be considerate, courteous, or empathetic about other people's experiences presents an opportunity to create a critical advantage. These "little conveniences" cause customers to form an emotional connection and advocate for the product.

#### Examples of Craftsmanship in Slack
1.  **Magic Link Authentication:** Recognizing that typing strong passwords on a phone is a "terrible experience," Slack introduced sending a link to the user's email address that would automatically open and authenticate the app.
2.  **The Shouty Rooster (@everyone warning):** To prevent the abuse of the `@everyone` feature (which caused notifications to all channel members) and shape communication culture, a "shouty rooster" image would pop up, asking the user to confirm the action and warning them about the number of people who would receive a notification (e.g., "147 people in eight different time zones"). This investment taught people how the product worked and made a "really big difference".
3.  **Thoughtful DND Rollout:** When implementing the "Do Not Disturb" (DND) feature, Slack used an elaborate rollout system to balance the strong opinions of system owners (administrators) and individual end-users. This included giving organizations advance notice and setting a default DND time (e.g., 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. in the local time zone) that users could override. Setting the default was critical, as the average person likely wouldn't turn the feature on themselves.

### III. Organizational Dynamics and Leadership

#### Parkinson's Law and Hyper-Realistic Work-Like Activities (HRWLA)
The original maxim of Parkinson's Law is that "work expands to fill the time available for its completion". This manifests in organizations because the overwhelming majority of employees, particularly managers, want to hire more people who report to them, as this correlates with career trajectory, pay, and authority.

*   **Known Valuable Work:** Early-stage startups have an enormous amount of work that is known *and* valuable (e.g., creating a user database, opening a bank account).
*   **The HRWLA Trap:** As organizations grow, the supply of known valuable work diminishes. Employees who have demand for work (because they were hired to perform specific roles) begin engaging in **Hyper-Realistic Work-Like Activities** (HRWLA). HRWLA is "superficially identical to work" (e.g., sitting in conference rooms reviewing slides) but is actually a "fake bit of work". This happens not because people are evil or stupid, but because they seek recognition and wins.
*   **The Leader's Responsibility:** The ultimate responsibility lies with the leader to ensure there is a sufficient supply of known valuable work to do, often by creating clarity and explicitly saying "no" to non-priorities upfront.

#### Pivoting
Stewart Butterfield co-founded two companies (Flickr and Slack) that famously pivoted from video games. He advises that the decision to pivot must be **coldly rational** rather than emotional. Pivoting is "fucking humiliating" due to the promises made to investors, employees, and users. A good time to pivot is when one has exhausted all the *good* and *realistic* possibilities of the current idea.

#### Perpetual Desire to Improve
Butterfield believes in a **perpetual desire to improve**. In 2014, the year Slack officially launched, he stated: **"I feel like what we have right now is just a giant piece of shit... we should be humiliated that we offer this to the public."**. He suggests that if one cannot see "almost limitless opportunities to improve," they shouldn't be designing the product.

### IV. Long-Term Strategy and Values

#### Value Creation Chant
A core value that Stewart Butterfield instilled at Slack, often making the entire company repeat it as a chant at all-hands meetings, was: **"in the long run the measure of our success will be the amount of value that we create for customers"**.

*   **Long-Term Success:** This philosophy encourages an ethical way to run a business and helps attract a better class of employee.
*   **No Substitute:** While effort can be put into demonstrating value, "there's no substitute for actually having created it".

#### Generosity and Cooperation
Generosity is viewed as a strategic demonstration of cooperation (in the context of the Prisoners' Dilemma) which encourages reciprocal cooperation, leading to mutual long-term benefit.

Examples of this generosity include:
*   Paying 100% of employees' health insurance to give them fewer things to worry about.
*   Creating a highly employee-friendly acquisition structure and public offering (direct listing, no lock-up).
*   Implementing **fair billing**, where customers were not charged for seats they weren't using.
*   A former Service Level Agreement (SLA) that offered customers 100 times their money back for downtime, a policy that was automatically and proactively applied, even if the outage did not affect the specific customer.

#### The "We Don't Sell Saddles Here" Memo
This legendary internal memo, written before Slack launched, emphasizes that product creation and market creation are "one and the same".

*   **The Message:** It's insufficient just to build a great product; significant effort must go into communicating what the product *does for them*.
*   **The Analogy:** Instead of trying to sell a saddle (the feature), communicate the incredible experience of horseback riding (the value/outcome), leading the customer to realize, "I need a saddle to do that". Marketers should sell the "yearning for the sea," not the ship. It is easier to create a new idea by combining existing ideas (like "Uber for pets") than by introducing a wholly net new concept.

**Analogy for Comprehension vs. Friction:**

The difference between focusing on reducing friction and focusing on improving comprehension is like the difference between trimming the length of a long, confusing map, and simplifying the map so that you instantly know the most important places and the easiest route to your destination. A shorter map might mean fewer clicks, but if you still have to stop and *think* about what every symbol means, the friction of thought remains high. The goal is clarity, not just conciseness.
