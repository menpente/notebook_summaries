# DX Platform Walkthrough Briefing

**Date:** _Transcript Summary_  
**Presenter:** Internal walkthrough recording  
**Context:** Overview of the DX platform’s key features, navigation, and data insights tools within the sandbox environment.

***

## Overview

The DX platform centralizes data from multiple systems (e.g., GitHub, Jira) to provide metrics and insights on team productivity, software delivery, and AI tool usage.  
It offers different views (organizational, group, and individual) and enables leaders to track performance, identify bottlenecks, and plan improvements.

## Key Platform Areas

### 1. Dashboard
- **Purpose:** High-level visualization of productivity and performance metrics.  
- **Views:**  
  - **Organizational view:** Company-wide KPIs.  
  - **Group view:** Team-level performance for managers.  
  - **Personal view:** Individual metrics and outcomes.
- **Tabs:**
  - **Overview:** Highlights the core productivity metrics across four dimensions.
  - **Delivery Metrics:** Tracks pull requests, issues, and team workload.
  - **Reports Flows:** Automatically populated from integrated tools (e.g., Jira); customizable by user.
  - **Insights:** Highlights anomalies, leadership focus areas, and potential inefficiencies.

***

### 2. Snapshots
- **Purpose:** Analyze quarterly self-reported productivity assessments.  
- **Content:**  
  - Surveys take about 5–10 minutes and measure aspects such as:
    - Local iteration speed  
    - Documentation quality  
    - Time available for deep work  
  - Provides benchmarking across customers and internal teams.
- **Features:**
  - Assigns scores with benchmark comparisons.  
  - Visual breakdowns by team or organization level.  
  - Voting mechanism to prioritize areas for improvement.  
  - Comment threads for context and qualitative insight.  
  - Recommendations (short- and long-term) for productivity enhancements.
- **Quantitative Measures:**  
  - Workflow data on areas like CI wait time, review delays, and interrupt frequency.  
  - Heatmaps identify systemic friction or isolated team challenges.  
  - Pivot views by team, geography, job level, or tool usage.

***

### 3. Reports (DX Data Cloud)
- **Purpose:** Aggregate quantitative data from engineering systems for analysis of software delivery performance.
- **Categories:**
  - **DORA Metrics:** Deployment frequency, change failure rate, MTTR, etc.  
  - **Pipeline Data:** Build and deployment pipeline performance.  
  - **Efficiency Metrics:** Code review timelines, approval counts, PR cycle times.  
  - **Quality Data:** Incident rates, recovery metrics, and PR revert rates.  
- **Customization:** Multiple pre-built and linked reports for quick exploration.

***

### 4. GenAI Impact Reporting
- **Purpose:** Measure AI tools’ influence on productivity and development efficiency.
- **Focus Groups:**  
  - Compare **GenAI tool users** vs. **non-users** on KPIs like PR throughput and cycle time.  
  - Track changes as tool adoption progresses (no usage → light → moderate → heavy).
- **Examples of AI Tools:** Cursor, ChatGPT, Cody, GitHub Copilot.  
- **Insights Provided:**  
  - Throughput, PR size, and cycle time differentials between cohorts.  
  - Cohort analysis of AI adoption trends and output quality.

***

### 5. Data Studio & Custom Reports
- **Purpose:** Create and modify reports to align with specific organizational measurement standards.
- **Key Capabilities:**
  - Access to raw SQL behind reports.
  - “Copy to Studio” to customize calculations and save personalized views.
  - Full data schema reference.
  - AI-assisted report generation (natural language queries to create reports).
- **Benefit:** Flexibility to tailor analytics at both enterprise and team levels.

***

## Takeaways and Recommendations

- Begin by exploring the **Dashboard**, **Snapshots**, and **Reports** tabs.
- Review **AI impact reports** to evaluate GenAI adoption outcomes.
- Use **Data Studio** or the integrated AI agent for custom insights.
- Expect supplementary materials and direct report links from the presenter.
- Follow up session suggested for live walkthrough and Q&A.
