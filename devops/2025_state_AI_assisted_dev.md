# AI-Assisted Software Development Briefing: 2025 State of the Industry

Drawing on insights from the 2025 DORA research, this briefing summarizes the current state of AI adoption and its relationship to key organizational and technical outcomes.

## 1. Executive Summary: AI as an Amplifier

The central truth revealed by the research is that **AI's primary role in software development is that of an amplifier**. It magnifies the strengths of high-performing organizations and the dysfunctions of struggling ones.

The greatest returns on AI investment stem not from the tools alone, but from a strategic focus on the **underlying organizational system**. Without this foundational system (e.g., quality internal platforms, clear workflows), AI risks creating localized pockets of productivity that are often lost to downstream chaos.

## 2. Key Findings on AI Adoption and Impact

### Adoption and Skepticism

*   **Near-Universal Adoption:** AI use in software development has become the standard. Ninety percent (90%) of survey respondents report using AI at work, a 14.1% increase over last year.
*   **Reliance:** A full 60% of AI users employ AI "about half the time" or more when encountering a problem or task. Sixty-five percent (65%) report relying on AI a "moderate amount," "a lot," or a "great deal" at work.
*   **Top Use Case:** The number one use for AI tools is **writing new code** (71% of respondents who write code use AI to assist them).
*   **Trust But Verify:** While AI adoption is widespread, a healthy skepticism exists. A notable portion (30%) currently report little to no trust in the code generated by AI, indicating a critical need for validation skills and training.

### Impact on Outcomes

AI adoption demonstrates a complex relationship with organizational outcomes:

| Outcome | Estimated Effect of Higher AI Adoption (Standardized) | Trend Comparison to 2024 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Individual Effectiveness** | Higher levels | Positive association holding steady |
| **Code Quality** | Higher levels | Positive association holding steady |
| **Software Delivery Throughput** | Higher levels | **Reversed from negative to positive** (suggesting adaptation) |
| **Product Performance** | Higher levels | **Shifted from neutral to positive** (suggesting adaptation) |
| **Valuable Work** | Higher percentage of time | **Reversed from negative to positive** (suggesting adaptation) |
| **Organizational Performance** | Higher levels | Positive association holding steady |
| **Software Delivery Instability** | **Higher levels** | Continues to increase |
| **Burnout** | Similar levels (No measurable relationship) | Stubbornly flat |
| **Friction** | Similar levels (No measurable relationship) | Stubbornly flat |

The persistence of instability, friction, and burnout suggests that these issues are tied to the **sociotechnical system** (process and culture) rather than being fixed by AI tools alone.

## 3. Strategic Imperatives: The DORA AI Capabilities Model

The inaugural **DORA AI Capabilities Model** identifies seven foundational practices necessary to unlock the value of AI and amplify its positive impact on performance. Investing in these areas is proven to realize greater returns on AI adoption.

| Capability | Impact Amplified by AI Adoption | Core Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Clear and Communicated AI Stance** | Amplifies positive influence on **Individual Effectiveness** and **Organizational Performance**; makes neutral effect on **Friction** beneficial (decrease). | Establish and socialize a clear policy on permitted tools and usage to build developer trust and reduce friction. |
| **2. Healthy Data Ecosystems** | Amplifies positive influence on **Organizational Performance**. | Invest in the quality, accessibility, and unification of internal data sources. |
| **3. AI-accessible Internal Data** | Amplifies positive influence on **Individual Effectiveness** and **Code Quality**. | Connect AI tools to internal systems (codebases, documentation) to move beyond generic assistance and provide company-specific context. |
| **4. Strong Version Control Practices** | Frequent commits amplify **Individual Effectiveness**; ability to rollback amplifies **Team Performance**. | Encourage teams to become highly proficient in rollback and revert features, acting as a critical safety net against AI-accelerated instability. |
| **5. Working in Small Batches** | Amplifies positive influence on **Product Performance**; makes neutral effect on **Friction** beneficial (decrease). | Enforce the discipline of working in small batches to ensure localized productivity gains translate to system-level benefits. |
| **6. User-centric Focus** | Amplifies positive influence on **Team Performance**. **Critical warning:** In the absence of this focus, AI adoption can *negatively* impact team performance. | Center users’ needs as a product’s North Star to guide AI-assisted developers toward appropriate goals. |
| **7. Quality Internal Platforms** | Amplifies positive influence on **Organizational Performance**. | Treat the platform as a **holistic product** designed to improve developer experience, providing the necessary guardrails and capabilities for AI to scale effectively. |

## 4. Systemic Foundations

### Platform Engineering

Adoption of platform engineering is now nearly universal (90% of organizations).

*   A **high-quality internal platform** is the essential foundation for AI success. It functions as a **strategic prerequisite** for unlocking the organizational value of AI, acting as a distribution and governance layer.
*   High-quality platforms improve organizational performance, product performance, and team well-being.
*   **Dedicated platform teams** are the dominant organizational model (76% adoption).
*   Platform teams must adopt a **product mindset**, focusing on the holistic developer experience to avoid pitfalls like the "ticket-ops trap" or the "ivory tower platform".

### Value Stream Management (VSM)

**VSM acts as a force multiplier for AI investments**.

*   The practice of visualizing, analyzing, and improving the flow of work from idea to customer ensures that local productivity gains translate into measurable team and product performance.
*   Organizations with strong VSM practices see the impact of AI adoption on **organizational performance dramatically amplified**.
*   VSM enables focused improvement by helping teams understand their workflow and apply AI strategically to constraints, such as improving a bottlenecked code review process, rather than simply generating more code that exacerbates the problem.

## 5. Conclusion: Treating AI as a Transformation

AI adoption must be treated as an **organizational transformation**. Transformation requires revising how work itself flows. Organizations should invest in redesigning their systems to identify constraints and enable the conditions where local acceleration becomes organizational momentum.

The goal is continuous learning and improvement. Organizations are encouraged to run experiments, conduct internal surveys, and embrace systems thinking to discover what drives the highest performance in their specific context.
