# Briefing Document: All-Terrain Investment Strategy for 2026

Drawing upon empirical data from the past, the goal is to position investors optimally for 2026 and compose a crisis-proof, "all-terrain" portfolio. The year 2025 was very turbulent, and 2026 is likely to continue this trend.

## I. Speaker Credibility and Philosophy

The speaker has 20 years of investing experience, studied at prestigious institutions like the London School of Economics, is an approved financial advisor by the CNMV, and has authored bestselling books. The speaker achieved financial freedom through these learned strategies.

The core philosophy rejects the use of a "crystal ball" or predicting the "next big stock". Instead, the strategy focuses on **empirical data** and structuring an investment portfolio built on multiple pillars (the Parthenon of Investments) to withstand any market condition.

## II. 2025 Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Events (5 Key Events)

Understanding the past year sets the foundation for 2026:

1.  **Global Stock Market Collapse and Volatility Spike:** US and other global exchanges (S&P 500, Nasdaq, DAX) collapsed strongly in March and especially April. This was initially driven by tariff pressures from President Donald Trump. Volatility (VIX index) reached levels not seen since August 2024. Markets eventually rebounded to new historic highs.
2.  **Critical Increase in Public and Private Debt:** Global debt surpassed **256% of world GDP** in 2025. High interest rates and risk premiums increased the cost of debt in large economies (US, Europe) and emerging countries (Turkey, Argentina), raising alerts about financial sustainability.
3.  **Geopolitical Tensions and Trade Wars:** The return of President Trump caused uncertainty in international trade and led to the re-configuration of the TMEC agreement (replacing NAFTA). Commercial wars and new protectionist policies severely impacted US-China relations, supply chains, and global growth.
4.  **Definitive End of Inflationary Pressures:** Price stabilization consolidated in 2025, following years of high inflation (2022-2023). This control implies greater economic resilience and adjustments in monetary policies globally, though economic recovery remains resistant.
5.  **Historical Concentration and Business Transformation:** The largest global companies continue to dominate stock indices. Disruptive technologies (AI, digitalization, robotization) are accelerating mergers, acquisitions, and business transformation internationally.

## III. 2026 Outlook and Key Considerations (5 Elements)

These elements will redefine the investment landscape for 2026:

1.  **Fragmentation and Protectionism:** The global economy is expected to continue fragmenting with increased commercial barriers, tariffs, and sectoral sanctions among major blocs (US, Europe, China). This modifies the rules for international investment.
2.  **Nearshoring/Friend-shoring Trend:** The trend of reconfiguring supply chains to reduce geopolitical reliance will intensify. This creates a **powerful, long-term investment trend** that favors regions with stable commercial relations and political stability (e.g., Mexico, Eastern Europe). Sectors poised for growth include manufacturing, logistics, and infrastructure in these areas.
3.  **Advanced Technological Transformation:** Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will continue to revolutionize business models and processes. Companies that adopt AI, automation, and advanced data analysis are better positioned to resist volatility and optimize efficiency.
4.  **Emergence of New Economic Engines:** Economic growth is expected to shift toward Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. **India is specifically highlighted as the growth leader for 2026**. Opportunities exist in technology, infrastructure, and renewable energy within these emerging markets.
5.  **High Cost of Refinancing Global Debt:** The primary challenge in 2026 will be the high cost of refinancing the massive debt accumulated by governments and corporations during years of low interest rates.

    *   **Investment Implication:** Strict selection of companies with **solid balance sheets and high free cash flow** is critical. Public debt will maintain upward pressure on long-term rates.

## IV. The Six Pillars of the All-Terrain Investment Parthenon

The ideal "all-terrain" portfolio should rest on multiple pillars (minimum two) to maintain stability during crises.

| Pillar | Strategy/Focus | Key Details/Recommendations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Stock Market (Bolsa)** | **Index/Robo-Advisors:** Easiest and most accessible starting point. **Dividend Investing:** Solid strategy that benefits from rising markets (capital gains) and falling markets (lower beta, allowing discount purchases). **Value Investing:** Seeking undervaluation—buying assets where the price is low relative to the intrinsic value. | Recommended Robo-Advisors: **Indexa Capital** and **My Investor**. For conservative profiles, Robo-Advisors will automatically include fixed income for stability. |
| **2. Real Estate (Inmobiliario)** | Direct Investment or Indirect Exposure (REITs/SOCIMs). | Lower interest rates increase competition, making finding profitable opportunities more difficult. Indirect investment options include REITs/SOCIMs (via Pillar 1) or Real Estate Crowdfunding (via Pillar 6). |
| **3. Cryptocurrencies (Criptomonedas)** | Exposure to high-potential, high-risk assets (Bitcoin, Ethereum). | The **Stock-to-Flow Model** suggests Bitcoin's price (currently $100,000+) is far below the projected $308,000, indicating potential for multiplication based on historical cycles. Recommended Allocation: Aggressive profiles: 5% to 10%. Conservative profiles: 1%. Passive income can be generated by staking or lending cryptocurrencies. |
| **4. Businesses (Negocios)** | Own Businesses, Franchises, and Startup Investment (Crowd Equity, Private Equity). | Highly accessible and growing in accessibility for 2026. High risk (9 out of 10 startups fail). Recommended only after establishing a well-diversified portfolio. |
| **5. Commodities/Precious Metals** | Defensive assets, hedges against geopolitical/macroeconomic risk. | **Gold** is recommended as a crucial defensive position ("fondo de cartera"). Recent market corrections (e.g., gold fell 11.50% from its historic max) are seen as necessary market breathing room and potentially opportune moments for purchase. Investors can purchase a diversified basket of commodities (e.g., 5% allocation). |
| **6. Alternative Investments** | Crowdfunding and Crowdlending. | **Real Estate Crowdfunding:** Collaborative financing in projects. **Crowdlending:** Participatory financing of loans, offering appealing returns and diversification. Preferred Crowdlending platform: **Mintos** (invested since 2016). |

## V. Strategic Diversification

Beyond the six pillars, a robust portfolio must incorporate comprehensive diversification:

*   **Sector Diversification:** Include both cyclical and counter-cyclical sectors.
*   **Geographical Diversification:** Look beyond similar economies (e.g., investing in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece is insufficient). Diversify across different regions and economic types: Europe (Spain, Germany, France), North America (Canada, US), Australia, Asia (India, China), and Africa (South Africa, Congo, Kenya).
*   **Currency Diversification:** Important to control for potential gains resulting from currency appreciation (e.g., the US dollar, which lost value against the Euro in 2025, may strengthen in 2026).

The fundamental keys to success are **controlling emotions**, adhering to an **all-terrain investment strategy**, and **maintaining calmness** in the face of market movements. History shows that markets rise over the long term despite recurring crises and short-term volatility.
