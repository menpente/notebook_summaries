# Dividend Portfolio Briefing: February Review ($160,000 Account)

## Executive Summary

This briefing outlines the performance and status of a dividend growth portfolio valued at approximately **$163,000** as of the recent reporting period. The primary long-term objective of the portfolio is to generate enough dividend payments to completely cover the investor's cost of living.

In February, the portfolio generated **$151.91 in dividend income**, which was the lowest monthly income in some time. This decrease was intentional, resulting from the sale of three high-yielding but low-growth stocks. The projected annual dividend income is currently **$5,121**.

## Portfolio Status and Allocation

| Metric | Detail | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Current Portfolio Value | ~$163,000 | |
| Total Gains | $32,523 (~24% up) | |
| Total Holdings | 30 positions (long-term goal is closer to 25) | |
| Cash Allocation | 11.6% (typically prefers closer to 15%) | |
| Overall Dividend Yield on Cost | 3.73% | |

The portfolio is primarily diversified, but the two largest positions dominate the holdings:

1.  **SCD:** The single largest position, chosen for its well-diversified nature, nice starting dividend yield, and expected ability to grow dividend payments over time. Capital was recently added via dollar-cost averaging.
2.  **Microsoft:** The second largest position, accounting for around 8% of the portfolio, currently showing a significant gain of 54.2%.

### Allocation by Industry

While ETFs make up the majority of the portfolio allocation, the source of dividend *income* shows a slight difference.

| Industry | Portfolio Allocation (%) | Dividend Income (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ETFs | 50.4% | Around 56% |
| Technology | 16% | Around 7.5% |
| Real Estate | 6.5% | Around 12% |
| Financial Services | 7.3% | N/A |
| Consumer Cyclical | 8.1% | N/A |
| Consumer Defensive | 4.9% | N/A |

## Recent Portfolio Activity

### Positions Sold

The investor recently sold three high-yielding positions because they were deemed unlikely to support the long-term goal of **growing dividend payments**:

*   Verizon Communications (starting yield over 6%).
*   Omega Healthcare Investors (yield around 8.58%).
*   Medical Properties Trust.

### Capital Added

Capital was added to three positions, two of which are Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs):

*   **V Properties:** Added capital as the company was trading at a good value. V Properties has demonstrated dividend growth, with quarterly payments increasing from $0.29 per share five years ago to $0.42 per share currently.
*   **Realty Income Corporation:** Added a small amount of capital because it was trading at a good value.
*   **SCD:** Dollar-cost averaged into the largest portfolio position.

The focus on REITs (V Properties and Realty Income) reflects the belief that real estate currently offers the best opportunities in the **high interest rate environment**.

## Key Performance Highlights

The investor emphasizes investing for the long term, although short-term gains have been notable.

*   **Best Gainer:** AVGO Broadcom (up over 154%).
*   **Other Significant Gains:** Caterpillar (up ~88%), JP Morgan (up ~75%), Microsoft (up ~54%).
*   **Recent Additions Performing Well:** Waste Management (up over 32%) and Louis Vuitton (up around 29%).
*   **Recent Dividend Hike:** Domino's Pizza, a current holding, recently announced a **25% dividend hike**, significantly outpacing the current inflation rate of around 4% or 5%.
*   **Current Positions Down:** The portfolio is transparently down on a couple of positions, notably 3M (~26.53%) and Realty Income (~5.8%).

## Long-Term Projections and Goals

The investor aims to reach financial independence by having monthly dividend payments surpass monthly cost of living.

### Financial Independence Timeline

Using a starting portfolio size of $160,000, an average monthly contribution of $2,500, a 7% price growth rate, and a 7% dividend growth rate:

*   **Current Cost of Living:** Assumed to be $4,000 per month.
*   **30-Year Projected Cost of Living:** Assuming 2% average inflation, the cost of living would increase to $7,240 per month.
*   **Projected Goal Achievement:** The analysis suggests the investor should be able to **live off dividend payments in approximately 15 years**, as this is when the projected monthly dividend payments surpass the projected monthly cost of living. At this point, the dividend growth rate is projected to be higher than the rate of inflation, meaning payments would sustain lifestyle even if dividends were not reinvested.

### Portfolio Value and Income Projection (Reinvesting Dividends)

The power of the "dividend snowball" effect is demonstrated by the compounding growth achieved through reinvesting dividends.

| Time Horizon | Annual Dividend Income (Projected) | Portfolio Value (Projected) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 Years | Over $16,000 | ~$466,000 |
| 15 Years | Over $63,000 | ~$1.8 million |
| 30 Years | Over $333,000 | Close to $9.5 million |

*Note: If dividends were not reinvested, the 30-year projections would be significantly lower: $145,000 in annual income and $4.1 million in portfolio value.*
