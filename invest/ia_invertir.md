## Briefing: Identifying Undervalued Stocks Using Investing Pro and AI

https://youtu.be/P_w6z9npeCQ

This briefing outlines the methodology and key technological tools utilized to identify potentially **undervalued stocks with enormous potential**. These are referred to as "positive wealth accidents"—companies that offer greater potential returns without requiring the assumption of greater risk.

### I. Investment Philosophy and Technology Reliance

Given the hundreds of thousands of quoted shares globally, identifying worthwhile investments is not an easy task. Therefore, modern analysis relies heavily on technology and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to accelerate the filtering process.

#### The Centaur Principle
Despite leveraging technology and AI, the investor must act as a **"centaur"**: technology is used for implementation and speed, but the final investment decision must always be made by the investor. It is crucial to know how to interpret the AI and refine the data provided.

### II. Core Analysis Tool: Investing Pro

The preferred tool for this type of analysis is **Investing.com**, particularly the paid version, **Investing Pro Plus**, which unlocks essential information not available in the free version.

The Pro version is considered extremely useful and valuable—potentially an "undervalued asset" itself—due to the quantity of quality, contrasted information provided. Users associated with "El Club de Inversión" may receive an additional 15% discount on any promotion.

#### Key Metrics Unlocked in Investing Pro
Beyond basic metrics like PER (Price-to-Earnings Ratio) seen in the free version, the Pro version provides tremendously useful data:

*   **Fair Value (Valor Razonable):** The price calculated by the program's mechanisms based on extensive studies.
*   **Analyst Price Target (Precio Objetivo de los Analistas):** Target price based on analyst consensus.
*   **General Status (Estado General):** Provides an immediate overview of the company’s financial health, saving significant analysis time.
*   **Filtering Criteria:** Extensive options to filter based on price, valuation, finances, dividends, growth, and profitability.

### III. Specific Screening Tools and AI Implementation

Investing Pro offers several powerful tools used to narrow the search from hundreds of thousands of stocks to a manageable list:

#### 1. Undervalued Stocks (Acciones Infravaloradas)
This feature directly screens companies whose stock price is trading below their objective value. The underlying principle is: **"Price is what you pay, value is what you receive"** (a concept attributed to Warren Buffett). When the market realizes a stock is discounted, capital flows in, raising the price toward the objective value. This tool performs an initial screening (criba) based on the selected market (e.g., German market).

#### 2. WN AI (Investment AI Tool)
Named after Warren Buffett ("WN AI"), this feature is accessed via an 'AI' button and allows users to ask specific questions about a company's stock prospects.

*   **Prompt Structure:** The tool can analyze a stock (e.g., CWCG) and determine whether it is likely to rise or fall based on fundamentals (PER, EPS growth), recent news, analyst consensus, price targets, and technical signals.
*   **Dual Analysis:** It provides both **fundamental analysis** (e.g., potential for revalorization based on fair value) and **technical analysis** (e.g., technical indicators showing bearish pressure or RSI in oversold territory).
*   **Deep Dive:** Users can request historical data (e.g., 10-year EPS evolution chart) and competitive analyses.
*   **Final Diagnosis:** Provides a conclusive summary, such as identifying a company as a "shadow stock" trading at a strong discount but warning of short-term risks due to technical weakness or negative recent Earnings Per Share (EPS).

#### 3. Pro PICS (AI-Selected Strategies)
Pro PICS are selection strategies ("Pro Pics") based on numerous empirical studies and the experience of investment professionals, filtered by AI.

*   **Strategy Example (SP20):** The "SP20 Better than S&P 500" strategy analyzes the 500 S&P stocks and selects the 20 most promising ones expected to outperform the market in the following month.
*   **Performance Tracking:** Strategies are shown with long historical data, which is generated through **back testing** (applying current strategies retroactively to historical quotation databases). For instance, one strategy demonstrated a 370% return compared to 56% for the IBEX 35 during the analyzed period.
*   **Strategy Insights:** Pro PICS provides the current list of selected stocks and a detailed **Pro Report** for each company, offering a condensed view of analyst projections, price targets, and a **SWOT/DAFO analysis** (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and challenges). This saves hours of manual analysis time.

### IV. Investor Application

The investor uses these tools to find individual actions with strong potential, which is the mechanism that truly accelerates the rate of enrichment, in addition to passive income generation. The data provided by Investing Pro serves as a **starting point**. After analyzing the analyst valuations and the platform's fair value, experienced investors conduct their own comparisons and analyses to verify their investment thesis.

**Analogy for Understanding the Process:**

Think of filtering stocks as searching for a valuable needle in a massive haystack. The free tools provide a large magnet (basic filters), but Investing Pro and its AI tools (WN AI, Pro PICS) provide **specialized, high-powered scanners** that significantly reduce the hay and pinpoint potential needles (undervalued stocks), allowing the investor (the Centaur) to quickly confirm the value manually before committing.
