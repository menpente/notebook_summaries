# Briefing Document: Real Estate Personal Shoppers (PSI)

### **1. What is a Real Estate Personal Shopper (PSI)?**
A Real Estate Personal Shopper (PSI) is an **expert advisor who accompanies a buyer throughout the entire process of purchasing a home**. Unlike traditional real estate agencies that may represent both the buyer and the seller—creating a clear conflict of interest—a PSI **works exclusively for the buyer**. Their primary objective is to secure the best property at the best possible price while serving as a strategic consultant, expert negotiator, and guide in every phase of the acquisition.

### **2. The Professional Process**
When hiring a PSI, the process typically follows seven distinct stages:
*   **Initial Interview:** A deep dive into the buyer's needs, location preferences, budget, and financial situation to avoid wasting time on unsuitable properties.
*   **Contract Signing:** A formal document detailing services, fees, and the initial provision of funds to ensure transparency.
*   **Active Search:** Accessing not only public portals but also **"off-market" properties** not available to the general public.
*   **Visits and Selection:** The PSI visits properties first to filter them, providing the buyer with detailed reports and **reducing unnecessary visits by up to 70%**.
*   **Expert Negotiation:** The PSI identifies the real value of the property and negotiates the price. They can typically achieve **discounts between 5% and 20%** of the initial asking price.
*   **Legal and Technical Management:** Handling contracts, coordinating with notarials, and reviewing technical or financial documents to ensure a safe purchase.
*   **Post-Sale Service:** Assistance with service name changes and other administrative tasks after the signature.

### **3. Fee Structures and Cost-Benefit Analysis**
PSI fees are generally structured in three ways:
1.  **Percentage-based:** Usually between **1% and 3%** of the final purchase price.
2.  **Fixed Fees:** A set amount agreed upon beforehand, often used for smaller transactions.
3.  **Mixed Model:** A combination of a fixed fee plus a percentage for more intensive services.

**Is it worth the investment?**
The sources suggest that the savings generated through negotiation often far exceed the professional's fees. For example, on a €300,000 property, a 10% negotiated discount saves the buyer €30,000. Even after paying a 2% fee (€6,000), the **net saving to the buyer is €24,000**, in addition to the time saved and reduced stress.

### **4. Real-World Application: The Morocco Case Study**
The value of a PSI is best illustrated by a real story involving students from the "Zenit" training program. While traveling in the Moroccan desert with nearly no internet connection, they were able to close a deal on a flat in Valencia. Their PSI handled everything: visiting the property, recording videos, coordinating with the seller and bank, and preparing the "arras" (earnest money) contract. The students received and signed the contract from their hotel in Morocco, ensuring they didn't lose a prime opportunity while they were away.

### **5. Strategic Selection: When to Hire (and When Not To)**
**Hire a PSI if:**
*   You are looking for properties in a **foreign country or a city far from your residence**.
*   You lack the time to filter properties and conduct visits.
*   The market is highly competitive or saturated.
*   You want access to exclusive off-market deals.

**Avoid a PSI if:**
*   You are buying in your own city and have **deep market knowledge**.
*   You have sufficient time to manage the process and enjoy doing it.
*   The market is not particularly competitive.

### **6. How to Find a Reliable Professional**
To ensure you are working with an ethical and competent professional, the sources recommend:
*   Searching through official associations like **AEPSI** (Spanish Association of Real Estate Personal Shoppers).
*   Investigating their professional track record and reading **online reviews/critiques**.
*   Ensuring they have **deep local knowledge** of the specific city where you want to buy.
*   Verifying that the contract clearly outlines all fees and services to avoid "surprises".
