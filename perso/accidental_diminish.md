# Briefing Document: The Accidental Diminisher and the Nine Tendencies

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DghTnxwZEGU

This document summarizes the core concept of the Accidental Diminisher, identifies the nine common diminishing tendencies in leadership, and outlines strategies and workarounds to mitigate their negative impact on team contribution and development, drawing from research on Multiplier practices.

## 1. The Challenge of Accidental Diminishing

The concept of the Accidental Diminisher addresses how leaders unintentionally stifle their teams' capabilities and ownership, often despite having the best intentions.

**Origin of the Problem:** One common origin of accidental diminishing is receiving misguided management advice, such as believing the leader’s job is to handle everything "new, important and hard" (i.e., complex problems) and letting the team handle everything else.

**Consequences:**
*   **Leader Impact:** Leaders end up overextended and potentially bitter handling all the difficult tasks, while receiving the spotlight and credit.
*   **Team Impact:** The diminishing effect can be as deep or deeper than that caused by a tyrannical leader. This approach essentially buffers the team from hard issues, leading to an "idle team" and stunted development, leaving people ill-prepared to deal with complex problems.

## 2. The Nine Accidental Diminisher Tendencies

Accidental diminishing is common, and nine specific types have been identified. Leaders often view these behaviors as strengths, but they can become liabilities when leadership is unaware of their diminishing impact.

| Tendency | Leader's Intention | Diminishing Outcome / Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Idea Fountain** | To share ideas and get the "party started," encouraging creativity and innovation. | People chase the boss's ideas, fail to dig deep, and underestimate the power of the leader's position. |
| **Always On** | To bring energy, motivate, and be infectious. | People find the leader "draining" and "exhausting". Others shut down and avert their eyes, leading to a scenario where no one gets heard. |
| **Rescuer** | Showing compassion, hating to see people fail, and wanting them to be successful. | People feel incapable and helpless, rendering them dependent and worried they lack the ability to get the job done. The behavior telegraphs the message: "I don't trust you" or "You can't handle it yourself". |
| **Pace Setter** | Leading by example and modeling what "good work" looks like. | Teams slow down and become spectators instead of followers. They may ask the leader for assignments, wanting to contribute but left in the pit crew. |
| **Rapid Responder** | Moving things forward quickly (speed, agility) so the team can move fast. | People wait for the leader to fill in the blanks, eroding ownership, as the boss's quick action makes ownership confused. |
| **Optimist** | Being positive, seeing victory, and focusing only on what will go well ("rose colored glasses"). | Teams are relegated to focusing on the downside. People feel invisible and worry the leader is completely unaware of their struggles and how difficult things are. |
| **Protector** | Shielding the team from heat and hard things coming from senior leadership or clients. | The team never sees reality or learns how to do difficult things. The leader acts as a **banyan tree** where nothing grows underneath. |
| **Strategist** | Being a big, bold thinker who casts a vision. | The leader is up at 30,000 feet, doing all the big thinking, while everyone else is stuck at ground level, only doing their piece. The team defers to the leader's thinking. |
| **Perfectionist** | Intensely desiring and needing quality, wanting to share "great work". | Creates a huge burden and demoralization. Teaches people to produce 80% work because the leader will redo or change it anyway (over-editing). |

### Distinction Between Rescuer and Protector

The difference lies in timing and orientation to the problem.
*   **Protectors** act "upstream of the problem" as filters, heading off hard things before the team ever gets a chance to see or start those projects.
*   **Rescuers** rush in *after* someone starts struggling, misses a milestone, or shows a lack of movement on a delegated task.

## 3. Strategies for Awareness and Feedback

For leaders to become more aware of their tendencies and mitigate their impact, they must get the language of accidental diminishing into the team.

**The Three-Minute 360:**
1.  The leader shares the list of diminishing tendencies (intention and outcome) with the team.
2.  The leader voluntarily names their own known tendencies (e.g., "I know I'm a rescuer") and asks the team for feedback and examples.
3.  The process is repeated with everyone else in the room.
This process allows the team to develop a shared language, making it safe and possible for real-time feedback to occur. The ultimate measure of success is when people feel comfortable teasing or laughing about the leader’s diminishing tendency, which signifies comfort in holding the leader accountable.

**Tools for Broadcasting Tendencies:** Leaders can use stickers, badges, or images (even those created via ChatGPT) to broadcast their tendencies. Broadcasting the tendency signals to the team that the leader is comfortable with the topic.

## 4. Simple Workarounds (Remedies)

Instead of eradicating a natural tendency, leaders can employ simple workarounds to change the impact of the behavior.

| Tendency | Recommended Workarounds |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Idea Fountain** | Create an **Idea Holding Tank** by writing ideas down (e.g., in a notebook or on post-it notes) and revisiting them later, preventing disruption to others. Use **soft opinion** when sharing ideas so they are not taken too seriously. |
| **Always On** | **Say it once and say it well**. |
| **Rescuer** | Practice **"Giving the Pen Back"**. When intervening, only give the **smallest amount of help possible** to get the person back on track, ensuring they ride the bike home themselves. Ask for the facts, as the person likely has a fix in mind and needs permission/discussion. |
| **Pace Setter** | **Stay within sight** on complicated projects. This prevents the team from feeling uninvolved or lost while the leader researches solutions. |
| **Rapid Responder** | Set a **mandatory waiting period** (e.g., 24 hours) for email responses, solving "day-old problems" instead of fresh ones. When responding quickly, focus on assigning an owner rather than fixing the problem. |
| **Optimist** | **Signal the struggle** by acknowledging difficulty (e.g., "This is hard. We're probably going to make some mistakes."). |
| **Protector** | Allow people to see reality and difficult things, enabling growth. The goal is to avoid leaving people "ill-prepared". |
| **Perfectionist** | **Define the standard** clearly ("what great looks like," "what complete looks like"). Focus corrections only on work that is legally inaccurate or creates risk, letting formatting and small stuff go. |

### Balancing Challenge and Diminishing

When holding a high bar (being a challenger), avoid being exhausting or diminishing by:
1.  **Breaking down the challenge** into small increments that feel "a little bit impossible, but just perhaps doable".
2.  **Becoming a serial challenger** rather than a "mega challenger," allowing moments for the team to relax, celebrate, and capture learning between increments.
3.  **Stoking belief** in the process, as this belief is what encourages people to lean in when they are uncomfortable.

*Analogy: An Accidental Diminisher is like a highly protective greenhouse owner. Their intentions are good: they shield their delicate plants (the team) from harsh sun, strong wind, and pests (complex problems, client demands, difficult tasks). However, by controlling the environment too tightly and doing all the hard work themselves, they prevent the plants from ever developing the strong roots and tough stems necessary to thrive independently outdoors, ultimately stunting their growth. A Multiplier leader, in contrast, manages the greenhouse but gradually exposes the plants to managed stress, enabling them to build resilience.*
