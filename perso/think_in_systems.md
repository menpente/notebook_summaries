# Briefing Document: Building Systems to Achieve Goals

This briefing summarizes the methodology of "thinking in systems" as a means for professionals to achieve complex goals, manage demanding schedules (such as balancing full-time work, learning, health, and relationships), and regain personal control and freedom.

## I. Defining Systems Thinking

Thinking in systems is presented as the secret to avoiding the "hamster wheel" of constantly feeling busy without making meaningful progress.

**Goal of Systems Thinking:**
The primary aim is to **reduce reliance on willpower and motivation**. Instead of depending on these factors, one builds processes that automatically help achieve the desired results. A system is formed by chaining these effective processes together.

**The Failure of Traditional Planning:**
Most individuals typically operate in terms of **intentions and tasks** (e.g., "I need to exercise today"). Even proactive people who turn intentions into specific **plans** (e.g., "I'm going to spend an hour every evening reading") often fail when they encounter obstacles, such as being too tired or when unexpected things come up. This cycle frequently leads to frustration and disappointment.

## II. The Three Core Principles for Building Systems

When looking at a problem through the lens of systems thinking, there are three principles to follow to build a system for one's goals.

### Principle 1: Think Holistically

This principle requires looking at an intention and considering all factors that might influence the goal's success.

*   **Proactive Failure Expectation:** You must proactively expect the plan to fail—expecting to be tired, lazy, or having things come up—and then ask what can be done to counter those issues.
*   **Identify Barriers:** It is crucial to gather a list of all possible barriers by reviewing things tried in the past and determining why they failed. The system created must account for these potential factors.

### Principle 2: Build for Repeatability

A system should be designed so that it does not rely on "all the stars aligning".

*   **Worst-Day Operation:** The system must be able to work even on the worst day.
*   **Minimize Reliance on Willpower:** Plans should be evaluated based on how repeatable they are and if their execution relies on willpower or motivation, which is considered a violation of this principle.
*   **Reduce Friction:** A key goal is to minimize friction as much as possible.
*   **Iterative Process:** Principles 1 and 2 are used in a cyclical process: Identify a high-effort activity (which relies on willpower), find ways to make it easier, then go back to Principle 1 to consider new challenges or obstacles that might make the new plan fail, and repeat. The goal is to arrive at a combination of solutions that "locks in that success".

### Principle 3: Peel the Band-Aids

The first system created will likely be full of "band-aids"—temporary solutions that help in the short term but fail to address the underlying issue.

*   **Identifying Band-Aids:** Examples of band-aid solutions include taking a nap for chronic tiredness or using a timer for poor focus, without addressing poor sleep habits or terrible attention span, respectively.
*   **The Limitation of Band-Aids:** Band-aid solutions overbloat the system and cause the plan to fail if the necessary conditions or tools are unavailable (e.g., no time for a nap, no timer available).
*   **Solving Underlying Issues:** Band-aids should be used only temporarily while actively working to solve the underlying problems. Working on these deeper issues often involves changing habits, which requires unlearning and retraining.
*   **Integrating Habit Change:** The act of changing habits so that the band-aids can eventually be removed should itself become part of the system (a new intention) and be plugged back through the first two principles. This ensures the system is effective both in the short term and the long term.

## III. Benefits and Outcomes

Building systems allows for significant life improvements, such as working full-time as a doctor, running a business, completing a master's degree, exercising, maintaining a social life, and consistently getting 8 to 9 hours of sleep.

*   **Clarity and Contingency:** Intentions and plans become much clearer and more specific, covering contingencies (e.g., "If I'm tired, I'll do this; if I'm not tired, I'll do this").
*   **Dynamic Approach:** The process creates a fluid and dynamic way to follow plans and achieve goals, adapting to unexpected challenges rather than relying on a rigid approach held up only by willpower.
*   **Discomfort vs. Progress:** While solutions may feel uncomfortable because they require making a change different from usual behavior, this discomfort is necessary to achieve a different result. The discomfort of making a change is often less severe than the constant stress, anxiety, and disappointment resulting from never making meaningful progress.
