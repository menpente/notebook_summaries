## Briefing Document: Insights from François Derbaix (co-CEO of Indexa Capital) on Risk, Diversification, and Business Strategy

This briefing summarizes the views and strategies of François Derbaix, co-CEO of Indexa Capital, concerning entrepreneurial risk, business partnerships, investment philosophy, and the unique operating model of Indexa Capital, drawing directly from the sources.

### I. Entrepreneurial Risk and Failure Management

Derbaix emphasizes that success is the exception in entrepreneurship, necessitating robust risk control.

*   **Failure is the Statistical Norm:** The **most probable outcome is that a business will fail**. Approximately **80% or more of launched businesses do not succeed** or reach a successful conclusion, often requiring them to be closed or sold poorly.
*   **Planning for Failure:** Given that failure is the statistical norm, entrepreneurs must plan for it. The core principle is to "expect the best, but prepare for the worst".
*   **Risk Control Measures:** Key strategies for managing entrepreneurial risk and ensuring the ability to try again include:
    1.  **Do not incur debt**.
    2.  **Do not invest more than you can afford to lose** in the business.
    3.  **Do not put your health at risk**.
*   **The "Rule of Survival":** Derbaix, citing Taleb, stresses that the fundamental rule is **"not to die" or not to ruin oneself**. Since reaching great success often requires trying multiple times, risk control is essential for recovery.
*   **Knowing When to Stop:** It is critical to know when to stop a failing venture. The point of no return is when the company has **negative net equity**, obligating the administrator to recapitalize or close/go into receivership. Going beyond this point can lead to catastrophic situations where administrators incur debts to the Social Security and tax authorities.

### II. The Divergence of Entrepreneurship and Investing

Derbaix clearly distinguishes the necessary focus for business success from the necessary strategy for investment success.

*   **Entrepreneurial Requirement (Focus):** For an entrepreneur to achieve success, they need **intense focus** (mucho foco) on their business, the customer, and their product.
*   **Investor Requirement (Diversification):** The skills required for a good investor are **"almost opposite"** to those needed by a good entrepreneur. An investor's key necessity is **diversification**.
*   **The Entrepreneurial Investment Error:** Entrepreneurs often mistakenly believe they can replicate their business success in investing, leading them to invest **too much, too quickly, in too few projects** (lack of diversification), causing many to lose money and quit private investing after only a few years.
*   **Personal Investment Strategy:** Derbaix personally decided to stop actively investing in startups because he found the long-term profitability was not as good given the **lack of liquidity and lack of diversification**. He now aligns his "skin-in-the-game" by investing more in Indexa (the liquid part) and Bwater (the illiquid part).

### III. Investment Philosophy: Passive Management and Indexation

Indexa Capital champions index investing based on systematic data showing long-term benefits derived from diversification and cost reduction.

| Feature | Index Investing (Passive) | Active Management (Traditional Bank) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Diversification** | High (invests in hundreds or thousands of shares). | Low (typically invests in only 40 shares). |
| **Costs** | **Five to ten times lower** than active management. | High; justified by active management complexity. |
| **Risk-Adjusted Return** | Better, due to more diversification and reduced risk. | Worse, due to higher costs eroding returns. |
| **Long-Term Performance** | Systematically outperforms active funds. At **20 years, typically only 1%** of actively managed funds beat their index. | Very few beat the index long-term; success does not persist. |
| **Incentives** | Aligned with client: Indexa is paid solely by the client. | Conflict of Interest: Banks market the most expensive funds that generate the highest margin for the bank. |

*   **Data vs. Active Management:** The systematic studies demonstrate that even before costs, active managers obtain the same average return as the market, meaning the true advantage of indexation comes from the **reduction in costs**. The rational conclusion for an investor is to **index to the world** to maximize diversification and reduce costs.

### IV. Indexa Capital Business Model and Growth

Indexa Capital differentiates itself through automation, long-term planning, and strict cost controls.

*   **Competitive Advantage:** Indexa uses an **automated management model** (they are currently 50 people managing 4 billion euros for 120,000 clients). This automation allows for **lower costs** (often five times lower than competitors), creating a **virtuous circle** where lower costs attract more volume, leading to even lower costs and improved client returns.
*   **Long-Term Strategy:** Indexa plans for the **5, 10, and 20-year horizon**. This commitment to the long term provides a crucial advantage over traditional banks whose directors are often focused on short-term results (quarters or semesters).
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Derbaix dedicates his time to **continuous improvement** ("mejora continua"). They believe in launching products quickly and iterating, following the rule that **"if when you launch your product you are not embarrassed, you have launched too late"**.
*   **Marketing Rules (Cost Control):** To ensure marketing spend does not compromise the low-cost structure, Indexa follows strict rules:
    1.  **Payback:** Investment in advertising must be recovered in **less than two years** (currently recovered in 14 months).
    2.  **Solvency:** The solvency ratio must be maintained above 150%.
    3.  **Profitability:** Annual profit must exceed the previous year's profit to satisfy shareholders.

### V. Lessons Learned and Personal Perspective

Derbaix shares insights on entrepreneurial partnerships, learning, and life lessons.

*   **Partnerships:** Entrepreneurship with friends or partners is **good for the business** because it involves high trust, but often **bad for the relationship** because conflicts can arise. His collaboration with his wife, Marta, succeeded due to alternating leadership roles.
*   **Learning and Practice:** He believes learning happens through **practice**. He prefers reading short **articles over books**. The final step in learning is sharing or teaching, which helps solidify the knowledge.
*   **Cycling (The Analogy):** His hobby, road cycling, taught him **resistance**, citing a 300 km solo ride. Mountain biking and skiing are a form of **meditation** because the danger and need for alertness prevent him from thinking about work.
*   **Advice for Daughters (and youth):** He emphasizes the importance of practice and effort over natural facility. He insists they never say they are "not good" at something (like math), advocating that dedication allows anyone to reach a high level.

*Analogy to solidify understanding:*

The difference between Derbaix’s view on entrepreneurial focus and investment diversification is like **driving a car versus maintaining a retirement portfolio.** As an entrepreneur (the driver), you must be hyper-focused on the road ahead, ignoring distractions to reach your single destination. As an investor, however, you must diversify the risk by taking many different transportation methods (buses, trains, planes, bikes) across the entire world, ensuring that if one mode fails, your entire journey is not ruined.
