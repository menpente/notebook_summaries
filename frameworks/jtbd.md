The Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework is a customer-centered approach for understanding why people buy and use products, based on the idea that customers “hire” products or services to achieve specific goals or complete tasks in their lives.[5][6]

### Core Concepts

- A “job” is a task, problem, or goal a person is trying to accomplish.[6][5]
- JTBD looks at the functional, emotional, and social dimensions of a person’s needs, moving beyond simple demographics.[8][6]
- Customers “hire” products for jobs and may “fire” (replace) them if they fail at delivering the desired outcome.[5]

### Key Steps of the JTBD Framework

- **Customer Research**: Conduct interviews and observations to understand the underlying jobs customers need to get done.[5]
- **Job Mapping**: Break down each job into steps, mapping the customer’s journey from the initial trigger to the final goal.[5]
- **JTBD Statement**: Summarize jobs in a clear statement: “When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].”[5]
- **Opportunity Identification**: Find where jobs are not being fully satisfied or where customer pain points exist.[5]
- **Solution Development**: Create or adjust products and messages to better fulfill those jobs.[6][5]

### Why Use JTBD?

- Guides innovation and product development by focusing on real customer needs instead of just features.
- Helps uncover unmet needs and opportunities in the market for differentiation.[6][5]
- Provides a robust foundation for product-market fit, strategic priorities, and competitive advantage.[6][5]

### Common Applications

- New product ideation and validation.
- Improving and differentiating existing products.
- Sharpening marketing strategies and product positioning.[6][5]

By focusing on what customers are trying to achieve, the JTBD framework ensures that innovation is driven by actual value creation and not just by assumptions or demographics.[8][6][5]
