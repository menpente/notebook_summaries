The Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework is a customer-centered approach for understanding why people buy and use products, based on the idea that customers “hire” products or services to achieve specific goals or complete tasks in their lives.[5][6]

### Core Concepts

- A “job” is a task, problem, or goal a person is trying to accomplish.[6][5]
- JTBD looks at the functional, emotional, and social dimensions of a person’s needs, moving beyond simple demographics.[8][6]
- Customers “hire” products for jobs and may “fire” (replace) them if they fail at delivering the desired outcome.[5]

### Key Steps of the JTBD Framework

- **Customer Research**: Conduct interviews and observations to understand the underlying jobs customers need to get done.[5]
- **Job Mapping**: Break down each job into steps, mapping the customer’s journey from the initial trigger to the final goal.[5]
- **JTBD Statement**: Summarize jobs in a clear statement: “When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].”[5]
- **Opportunity Identification**: Find where jobs are not being fully satisfied or where customer pain points exist.[5]
- **Solution Development**: Create or adjust products and messages to better fulfill those jobs.[6][5]

### Why Use JTBD?

- Guides innovation and product development by focusing on real customer needs instead of just features.
- Helps uncover unmet needs and opportunities in the market for differentiation.[6][5]
- Provides a robust foundation for product-market fit, strategic priorities, and competitive advantage.[6][5]

### Common Applications

- New product ideation and validation.
- Improving and differentiating existing products.
- Sharpening marketing strategies and product positioning.[6][5]

By focusing on what customers are trying to achieve, the JTBD framework ensures that innovation is driven by actual value creation and not just by assumptions or demographics.[8][6][5]

To do JTBD (Jobs-to-be-Done), follow a structured process aimed at uncovering the real tasks, outcomes, and motivations driving your customers’ choices and behaviors.[1][2][3][4]

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Identify Core Customer Jobs
- Conduct interviews, surveys, or observations to determine what tasks your customers are “hiring” your product or service to accomplish.[2][4][1]
- Focus less on demographics and more on behavior, context, motivations, and outcomes.[4][2]

#### 2. Map the Customer Job Journey
- Break each job into discrete steps with a job map, such as defining, locating inputs, preparing, confirming, executing, monitoring, modifying, and concluding.[5][3]
- Look for pain points and opportunities during each step to understand where your solution can make the most impact.[3][2]

#### 3. Capture Dimensions and Desired Outcomes
- Analyze not just functional, but also emotional and social drivers behind customer actions.[6][2]
- Write desired outcome statements (“minimize hassle,” “save time”) that express how customers measure success when completing a job.[6]

#### 4. Prioritize and Group Jobs
- Group similar jobs and rank them by importance, frequency, and level of frustration (pain points).[2][3]
- Focus resources on the jobs your product can solve best, not trying to solve every possible job.[3]

#### 5. Develop Solutions
- Use JTBD insights to inform product development, marketing messaging, and overall strategy, ensuring every initiative aligns with customer jobs and desired outcomes.[1][2]
- Consider solution-agnostic approaches; explore multiple ways to solve priority jobs, not just refining your current product.[6][2]

### Practical Tips

- Use cross-functional teams (PMs, designers, engineers, marketers) to analyze and act on JTBD findings.[7]
- Apply JTBD at multiple levels: for product design, UX, marketing, and business strategy.[2][6]
- Keep outcome statements and job maps as living documents, updating them as you gather further insights.[1][6]

The JTBD framework is powerful for uncovering true customer needs and motivating teams to innovate, keeping them focused on outcomes rather than just features or market segments.[4][1][2]
