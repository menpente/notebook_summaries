Amazon Leadership Principles: A Detailed Briefing

This briefing synthesizes key themes and ideas from excerpts of Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's explanations of Amazon's Leadership Principles. These principles serve as the cultural bedrock of Amazon, guiding decision-making, innovation, and employee development.

I. Customer-Centricity: The Unifying Theme
At the core of all Amazon's leadership principles is an unwavering "Customer Obsession." This principle is presented as the starting point for all endeavors at Amazon, shaping strategy, product development, and even economic considerations.

"Everything starts with the customer and works backwards from there," states Jassy. This "working backwards" approach is exemplified by the internal practice of writing press releases and FAQ documents before writing any code for a new product, ensuring its value to the customer is clearly defined and vetted.
Prioritizing customer needs over short-term gains or competitor concerns: The decision to implement customer reviews on book detail pages, despite publisher resistance, demonstrates this commitment. Similarly, during the pandemic, AWS proactively helped customers cost-optimize rather than "extract every last dollar," aiming for long-term customer success.
Sustainable customer value: While customer obsession is paramount, Jassy clarifies that it must be economically viable. "You're not really doing right by customers over a long period of time if you get them excited about something that you can't sustain." This highlights a balance between delighting customers and ensuring the long-term health of the business.
Awareness of competitors, but not obsession: Leaders "pay attention to competitors they obsess over customers." This means learning from competitors' successful innovations to improve Amazon's offerings, rather than simply mimicking them.
II. Decision-Making & Execution: Speed, Judgment, and Detail
Several principles address the critical aspects of effective decision-making and efficient execution within Amazon's highly ambiguous and competitive environment.

"Bias for Action": This principle emphasizes the critical role of speed in business, particularly in a world of "closing windows."
Distinction between "one-way door" and "two-way door" decisions: The overwhelming majority of decisions are "two-way doors" – reversible and should be made quickly at the team level. "One-way door" decisions, which are far fewer, require careful, deliberate thought.
Speed as a cultural choice: Jassy stresses that speed is not "pre-ordained" but a "leadership and a culture decision." Even large, established companies can cultivate a fast-moving culture.
Tension with "Highest Standards": While speed is crucial, it cannot come at the expense of quality. Launching a "subpar customer experience also breaks the Customer Obsession leadership principle." The challenge lies in finding the right balance.
"Are Right, A Lot": This principle is a proxy for strong judgment and good instincts, especially in areas of high ambiguity.
Seeking diverse perspectives and disconfirming beliefs: Being "right a lot" doesn't mean always having your idea carry the day. Instead, it involves getting "the right people in a room," listening to different perspectives, and "questioning my close most closely held beliefs" to arrive at "the best possible answer for customers whoever's idea it is."
Finding the signal in the noise: Leaders must be adept at "through all the different noise and finding the signal and what really matters for customers."
"Dive Deep": This principle emphasizes the importance of understanding and scrutinizing details.
Strategic thinking AND detail orientation: Amazon expects leaders to be both strategic ("Think Big") and "willing to roll up their sleeves and be great at getting into the details."
Details matter most: "The reality is that the details of any idea are what matters most that's what people actually see what customers actually see." This is why narrative-based documents (like working backwards documents) are preferred over high-level PowerPoints, as they make it "hard to fake the details."
Following anecdotes: Leaders must be skeptical when "metrics and anecdotes differ" and should "follow the anecdotes" because they often reveal "the real issues that can impact customers," even if not statistically significant in large datasets.
"Deliver Results": This principle underscores that ultimately, execution matters most.
Focus on inputs, not just outputs: While outputs (stock price, revenue) are important, leaders must actively manage the inputs – "the actual initiatives that we're all pursuing to change the customer experience."
Launch is the starting line, not the finish line: Delivery is not the end, but the beginning of an iterative process. "You always have to launch you have to see what customers react to you have to get feedback from customers and you have to iterate." The best teams are "fast and organized about launching but then they're constantly iterating."
III. Innovation and Growth: Thinking Big and Frugally
Amazon's culture fosters continuous innovation and growth, driven by ambitious thinking and resourceful execution.

"Invent and Simplify": Leaders are expected to "expect and require Innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify."
Constant invention and reinvention: Companies must constantly invent new things (like AWS) or "completely reinvented our existing business" (like the Marketplace). Stagnation by "just iterating in small ways on that original invention idea" is a path to irrelevance.
"Not invented here" is not a limitation: Leaders are "externally aware" and "look for new ideas from everywhere."
Simplification as a key to invention: The success of the Marketplace came from the "simplifying assumption that we will have all our third party selection on the same detail Pages as our first party retail selection."
"Think Big": This principle encourages leaders to challenge the status quo and envision ambitious futures for customers.
"Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy": Leaders must "create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results."
"Look around corners": Leaders must anticipate future customer needs, technological advancements, and competitive landscapes.
Continuous evolution: To build a company that lasts, "you cannot run the same playbook for decades at a time." This requires taking risks and pursuing different approaches.
"Frugality": This principle emphasizes resourcefulness and efficiency in achieving goals.
"Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention": Jassy highlights that limitations can spark greater creativity and operational excellence. The creation of S3 and EC2 with "13 person teams" is a testament to this.
No "extra points for growing headcount budget size or fixed expense": The focus is on doing "more with less."
Saving money for customers: Frugality allows Amazon to "invest more in giving people customers lower prices and giving them more capabilities."
Maintaining frugality at scale: Despite being a large company, Amazon actively fights against becoming "numb" to large numbers, expecting even large teams to operate leanly.
IV. People and Culture: Trust, Development, and High Standards
Amazon's principles also define the expected behaviors and responsibilities related to building and nurturing its workforce.

"Earn Trust": This principle emphasizes honesty, authenticity, and accountability.
Beyond "being nice": Earning trust means "being honest authentic straightforward listening intently but challenging respectfully if you disagree and then delivering what you said you would."
Vocally self-critical: Leaders must "own it, say it's not going well, be self-critical and fix it" when things go wrong, as demonstrated by Jassy's own experience with a flawed presentation.
Using data for assessment: Leaders should "Benchmark themselves in their teams against the best" using data to accurately assess performance.
"Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit": This principle encourages candid challenge and unified execution.
Obligation to challenge: Employees are "not just empowered to speak up if you think we're doing something wrong... you're expected to do so regardless of level."
Truth-seeking over social cohesion: The goal is to "get to Truth for what matters to customers," not to compromise for the sake of getting along.
Unified commitment after decision: Once a decision is made, "we have to as a group disagree and commit and wholly commit to that decision even if you were on the other side of what got decided."
"Hire and Develop the Best": This principle focuses on attracting, growing, and retaining top talent.
Raising the performance bar: Every hire and promotion should raise the overall performance standard. "Do not lower the bar" even under time pressure.
Respect and admiration: Working with people "we respect and admire" is a key motivator and driver of results.
Manager as a coach: Being a manager is a "privilege" that comes with the responsibility to "actively developing the people on your team and coaching them," including providing "critical feedback" for growth.
"Insist on the Highest Standards": Leaders are expected to maintain "relentlessly high standards" for quality and performance.
Unreasonably high, yet right: Amazon's standards are "perhaps unreasonably high but it's the right level for what we're trying to accomplish."
Higher expectations lead to better results: Leaders set expectations and "model what good looks like" to leverage impact across the organization.
Continuous fight to maintain standards: Jassy acknowledges the difficulty of maintaining high standards, particularly during challenging times like the pandemic, but emphasizes that "it's a fight worth fighting."
V. Broader Impact: Responsibility and Employer Excellence
Amazon's newest principles address its role as a global entity and an employer.

"Strive to Be Earth's Best Employer": This principle focuses on creating a positive and inspiring work environment.
Inspiring mission and large-scale impact: A great workplace is one where employees are "making customers lives easier and better every day" on a "very large scale."
Commitment to invention and long-term investment: A company that "is willing to invent and to invest and to bet" and "not running away the first time you see any lack of traction" is more inspiring.
Smart, passionate, and motivated team: Working with such a group, focused on a shared mission, defines a great work environment.
Continuous improvement for employees: While already a "pretty amazing place to work," Jassy acknowledges ongoing efforts to improve safety, manager development, and diversity/inclusion.
"Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility": This principle acknowledges Amazon's significant global impact and the need for thoughtful stewardship.
Beyond the garage: Amazon's size and reach mean it "impact the world" and must be "humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions."
Being a "great community member": This includes contributions to affordable housing, addressing homelessness, food security, education, and disaster relief.
Leaving things better: Leaders are expected to "create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them."
Daily determination to improve: The principle calls for starting each day with the "determination to make better do better better and be better for our customers our employees our partners in the World At Large."
In conclusion, these leadership principles represent a comprehensive framework for how Amazon operates, emphasizing customer obsession, rapid yet thoughtful execution, continuous innovation, a culture of accountability and development, and a growing recognition of its broader societal responsibilities. They are interconnected and often present inherent tensions, requiring leaders to navigate and balance them to achieve optimal outcomes.
