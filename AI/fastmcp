The source is a transcript from a YouTube video by "ZazenCodes" demonstrating the creation of a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** using **Python** and the **FastMCP 2.0 library**. The presenter provides a **high-level overview of the MCP protocol's architecture**, which involves a client like Claude Desktop communicating with a local server process via a transport layer such as standard I/O. The video then instructs viewers on how to **build this server using Claude Code as an AI assistant**, which automatically handles dependency installation and code generation for exposing **resources, prompts, and tools** through the server. Finally, the presenter shows how to **configure and test the server** with Claude Desktop and discusses **distributing the project** as a proper Python package suitable for deployment on PyPI.
