*I. Executive Summary*
The conversation around Artificial Intelligence has fundamentally shifted from theoretical adoption to demonstrating tangible business value. We are now in the "agentic era," where AI agents, combining the intelligence of advanced AI models with access to tools, can independently execute tasks and make decisions under human guidance. This report, based on a survey of 3,466 senior global enterprise leaders, highlights that companies quick to adopt AI agents are seeing significant returns on investment (ROI), justifying further investments and broader scaling strategies. Key findings indicate that 88% of agentic AI early adopters are now seeing a positive ROI on Gen AI, significantly outpacing overall market trends.

*II. Main Themes and Key Insights*
A. The Agentic Shift: From Predictive to Independent Execution
Evolution of AI: AI has progressed from predictive to generative, and now to the "agentic era." AI agents are defined as "systems that combine the intelligence of advanced AI models with access to tools, so they can take actions on your behalf and under your control."
Independent Task Execution: Unlike previous AI iterations, agents can "independently execute tasks and make decisions—under human guidance and guardrails."
Rapid Adoption: 52% of executives whose organizations use Gen AI have also adopted AI agents in production. This represents a "fundamental shift from AI that simply assists to AI that can operate independently under human control and guidance."
Widespread Deployment: "Though its core technologies were largely theoretical just a year or two ago, agentic AI is already in widespread deployment—deeply integrated across industries and around the world."
Competitive Frontier: AI agents are rapidly emerging as "the next competitive frontier," with 39% of executives stating their organization has launched more than 10 AI agents.
B. Tangible ROI and Early Adopter Advantage
Positive ROI: 88% of executives from agentic AI early adopter organizations see ROI on at least one Gen AI use case, compared to 74% across all organizations.
Justifying Investment: "This ROI helps justify bigger investments and get leadership on board for a broader AI scaling strategy."
Significant Advantage: Early adopters, who dedicate at least 50% of their future AI budget to AI agents and have them deeply embedded, are establishing a "significant competitive advantage."
Increased Budget Allocation: Agentic AI early adopter organizations allocate "39% of their organization’s total annual IT spend... to AI vs. 26% average."
Faster ROI and Broader Impact: Early adopters are "more likely to report significant value from Gen AI across key areas—including customer experience, business growth, security, and marketing." They are also "more likely to report ROI on all cross-industry agentic AI use cases."
