# Cursor 101: AI-Native IDE Briefing Document

## Executive Summary
Cursor is a **standalone IDE built from the ground up to be AI-native**, rather than being a simple "bolt-on" to existing stacks,. Originally based on a **fork of VS Code**, it provides a familiar environment for developers while integrating advanced AI capabilities like a proprietary CLI, coding agents, and code review features,. Today, it is used by over **100,000 enterprises globally**, including 89% of the Fortune 1000.

## Core Product Foundation
*   **VS Code Compatibility:** Because it is a fork of VS Code, users can seamlessly bring over their existing **extensions, hotkeys, and themes**,.
*   **Context Engine:** Cursor uses **vector embeddings** to index your entire codebase,. This generates a "global awareness" that allows the AI to find relevant code snippets based on natural language queries, such as connecting the term "API endpoints" to the actual corresponding code,.
*   **Model Agnostic:** While it has a default "Auto" mode to select the best model based on task complexity, users can manually select models from **Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini**,.

## Key AI Features

### 1. Cursor Tab (Next Action Prediction)
Tab is described as a **"next action prediction model"** that goes beyond simple autocomplete,.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** It looks at the current file, the global index of the codebase, and user feedback (accepts/rejects) to improve over time,.
*   **Best Use Cases:** Highly structured code like **API development, nested loops, case switch statements**, or repetitive patterns.
*   **Guidance:** Users can guide Tab by writing comments; for example, a comment like "make an endpoint to apply a skew" can trigger a specific implementation.

### 2. Command K (Inline Edits)
Also known as **"Quick Edit,"** this feature allows for surgical, inline modifications.
*   **Functionality:** Users select a block of code and provide a natural language prompt to refactor or edit it.
*   **Diff View:** Output is shown as a **diff**, where red represents overwritten code and green represents new changes,.
*   **Research Tool:** It can also be used to ask quick questions about specific functions to understand their role in the broader codebase,.

### 3. AI Agents
Agents are general-purpose tools designed to **reason across multiple files** and perform end-to-end tasks,.
*   **Architecture:** Agents consist of a Large Language Model (LLM), an orchestration layer (for memory and prompts), and a tools layer (to read/write files and run terminal commands),,.
*   **Thinking Models:** Cursor supports "thinking" models that output a reasoning trace before providing an answer, making them highly effective for **long-term, sequential sub-steps** and complex dependencies,,.

## Advanced Functionality

### Plan Mode
Plan Mode allows developers to **collaborate with the agent on a high-level strategy** before any code is written.
*   The agent asks clarifying questions to resolve ambiguities.
*   It generates a **Markdown-based task list** that acts as a "contract" for the development work,.
*   It is particularly useful for **vaguely defined features** or implementing requirements from a product document,.

### Cursor CLI
For developers who prefer other IDEs (like IntelliJ, Xcode, or Android Studio), the **Cursor CLI** allows them to use the same agentic patterns within their preferred environment,. It can also be run in **headless mode** for automated scripting.

## Best Practices & Context Management

*   **Context Management:** Every model has a **context window**, which acts like a "field of view",. Once this window reaches 100%, the system summarizes the history to make room for new information.
*   **Avoiding Context Rot:** "Context rot" occurs when a chat window becomes cluttered with irrelevant information from previous tasks, which can lead to hallucinations or poor responses,. Developers are encouraged to **start new chats (Command T)** for new tasks to keep the AI focused,.
*   **U-Turns:** If an agent makes a mistake, users can use the **U-turn button** to reset the code state to the point before that specific message,.
*   **Documentation:** Users can manually add **publicly accessible documentation URLs** to Cursor, allowing the agent to stay updated on bespoke or modern libraries that might be past the LLM's training cutoff,.

### Understanding the Context Window
To visualize the **context window**, imagine it as a **field of view** through a pair of binoculars. As you continue to feed the AI new information, it’s like moving objects closer and closer to the lenses; eventually, the view becomes so crowded that the AI can no longer see the "big picture" clearly, resulting in "context rot" where the responses lose focus,,.
